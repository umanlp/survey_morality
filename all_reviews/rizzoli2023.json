Psychosocial research has shown that to gain a better understanding of how it functions, it is crucial to investigate the psychological and cultural factors involved, such as individual characteristics, emotions, feelings, psychological distance, denial, and moral disengagement.", "paperContributionText": "The paper presents a classification system (risk Co-De model) based on a theoretical model that combines psychosocial processes of risk perception, including denial, moral disengagement, and psychological distance, with the aim of classifying social media posts automatically, using machine learning algorithms. The application of the risk Co-De model addresses the challenge of automatically identifying psychosocial processes in natural language, contributing to the understanding of the human approach to risk and informing tailored communication strategies.", "paperResultsText": "The Machine Learning model trained on the annotated dataset achieved an overall accuracy of 86% and a macro-average F1 score of 0.85, indicating good performance.", "theoryOtherText": "--", "theoryOwnText": "--", "theoryNone": "theoryNone", "definition": "definitionVague", "unitDocument": "unitDocument", "goalPerson": "goalPerson", "goalComparison": "goalComparison", "langOther": "Italian", "dataSM": "dataSM", "dataSMTwitter": "dataSMTwitter", "dataOtherText": "--", "dataDomain": "dataDomainPolitics", "dataDomainOtherText": "--", "resourcesOtherText": "--", "resource": "resourceYes", "annotSizeText": "2381 Tweets", "annotSetup": "annotTrained", "annotViews": "annotViewsNo", "AnnotSchema": "AnnotSchemaNo", "annotIAATypeText": "--", "annotIAAScoreText": "--", "annotIAAMetricText": "--", "IAA": "IAANo", "AnnotErrAnalysis": "AnnotErrAnalysisNo", "AnnotResourceAvailable": "AnnotResourceAvailableYes", "AnnotResourceAvailableYesURL": "https://hdl.handle.net/11573/1679485", "AnnotResourceAvailablePartlyURL": "--", "experiment": "experimentYes", "featML": "featML", "expTransformerText": "--", "expLlmText": "--", "semiMLText": "--", "unsuperMLText": "--", "expOtherText": "--", "ExpErrAnalysis": "ExpErrAnalysisYes", "replicTrainTest": "replicTrainTestAmbig", "replicGold": "replicGoldAmbig", "analysis": "analysisYes", "analysisField": "analysisFieldPsychology", "analysisFieldOtherText": "--", "analysisType": "analysisExplore", "dataAvail": "dataAvailYes", "dataYesUrlText": "https://hdl.handle.net/11573/1679485", "dataYesCommentText": "Dataset is available in the Iris repository https://hdl.handle.net/11573/1679485 from the corresponding author upon request.", "dataPartlyUrlText": "--", "replicPreproc": "replicPreprocClear", "replicCodeText": "--", "replicCode": "replicCodeNo", "validationAnnotation": "validationAnnotation", "validationOtherText": "--"}}
