Nevertheless, texts may involve more than one moral foundation, which are often assigned manually. Assignment methods should be designed to perform a multiple selection and do it in an automatic way.", "paperContributionText": "a Word Embedding-based Moral Foundation Assignment (WEMFA) approach has been designed, implemented, and applied to the movie domain for multiple assignment of moral foundations. WEMFA may use any dictionary, and it has been applied to a movie collection generated from movie synopses. In addition, an extension of the original MFD (MFD24) has been built by adding 14 new moral foundations to the 10 original ones, enriching the moral context.", "paperResultsText": "A comparison between WEMFA and MoralStrength, the only approach found in the scientific literature, has been carried out.
