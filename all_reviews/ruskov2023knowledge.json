In this paper, we focus on capturing the perceptions of these references of values, with the aim to study how they evolve over space and time.", "paperContributionText": "To this end, we present our approach that consists of a meta-model and two intertwined design processes for the creation of a knowledge graph capable of capturing an integrated representation of both values and perceptions. In particular, we illustrate how the input collected from different activities with the general public can feed the graph to represent multiple and possibly divergent perceptions of values in classical texts. Our meta-model allows for the integration of data from both established scientific techniques such as expert annotations on the one hand, and on the other from standard tests, social media activity, visual representations and games.", "paperResultsText": "The proposed approach gives practical means to make explicit both historical and current perceptions of values in classical works of art. Our approach and the resulting knowledge graph enable the comparative analysis of values and their perceptions over space and time.", "theoryHumanval": "theoryHumanval", "theoryOtherText": "--", "theoryOwnText": "--", "definition": "definitionVague", "unitDocument": "unitDocument", "goalFraming": "goalFraming", "goalPerson": "goalPerson", "goalAI": "goalAI", "langEn": "langEn", "langOther": "--", "dataOther": "dataOther", "dataOtherText": "The paper describes an approach for creating a moral KB, where different kinds of sources can be integrated.
