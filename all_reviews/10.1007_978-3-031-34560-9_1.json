We consider a novel concept of virtual reality innovation in museums, which is cognitively grounded and supported by data and their semantics, to enable users sharing their experiences, as well as to take the perspective of other users, with the ultimate goal of increasing social cohesion.", "paperContributionText": "An important feature of this system is the ability of detecting similarity and dissimilarity between user perspectives expressed in speech, when exposed to artworks. This ability helps defining an effective strategy for sharing diverse user perspectives for increasing social cohesion. Moreover, it enables an unbiased quantification of the success of the interaction in terms of change in the user perspective.", "paperResultsText": "The results show that the employment of unsupervised text classification models is a promising research direction for this task.", "theoryMFT": "theoryMFT", "numMF": "numMF6Liberty", "theoryOtherText": "--", "theoryOwnText": "--", "definition": "definitionVague", "unitSegment": "unitSegment", "goalFraming": "goalFraming", "goalPerson": "goalPerson", "langEn": "langEn", "langOther": "--", "dataOther": "dataOther", "dataOtherText": "Dialogues involving museum visitors who express their personal point of view", "dataDomain": "dataDomainOther", "dataDomainOtherText": "Art", "resourcesDict": "resourcesDict", "resourcesOtherText": "--", "annotSizeText": "--", "annotIAATypeText": "--", "annotIAAScoreText": "--", "annotIAAMetricText": "--", "AnnotResourceAvailableYesURL": "--", "AnnotResourceAvailablePartlyURL": "--", "resource": "resourceNo", "experiment": "experimentYes", "expLlm": "expLlm", "expLlmText": "BERT, NLI", "semiMLText": "--", "unsuperMLText": "--", "expOtherText": "--", "ExpErrAnalysis": "ExpErrAnalysisRudimentary", "replicTrainTest": "replicTrainTestNotRelevant", "replicGold": "replicGoldUnclear", "analysisFieldOtherText": "--", "analysis": "analysisNo", "dataYesUrlText": "--", "dataYesCommentText": "--", "dataPartlyUrlText": "--", "dataAvail": "dataAvailNo", "replicPreproc": "replicPreprocUnclear", "replicCodeText": "--", "replicCode": "replicCodeNo", "validationAnnotation": "validationAnnotation", "validationOtherText": "--"}}
