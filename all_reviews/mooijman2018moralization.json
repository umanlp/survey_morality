Despite widespread media attention, little scientific research has been devoted to understanding this rise in the number of violent protests. We propose that this phenomenon can be understood as a function of an individual\u2019s moralization of a cause and the degree to which they believe others in their social network moralize that cause.", "paperContributionText": "sing data from the 2015 Baltimore protests, we show that not only did the degree of moral rhetoric used on social media increase on days with violent protests but also that the hourly frequency of morally relevant tweets predicted the future counts of arrest during protests, suggesting an association between moralization and protest violence. To better understand the structure of this association, we ran a series of controlled behavioural experiments demonstrating that people are more likely to endorse a violent protest for a given issue when they moralize the issue; however, this effect is moderated by the degree to which people believe others share their values.", "paperResultsText": "Our work extends previous research on (sacred) values and violence by suggesting that strong moral convictions can increase the acceptability of violence20,36 and that (1) this happens primarily when convergence is high and (2) the link between moralization and violence can be tracked, and is shaped, by online social networks.", "theoryMFT": "theoryMFT", "numMF": "numMF5", "theoryOtherText": "--", "theoryOwnText": "--", "definition": "definitionVague", "unitDocument": "unitDocument", "goalFraming": "goalFraming", "goalPerson": "goalPerson", "langEn": "langEn", "langOther": "--", "dataSM": "dataSM", "dataSMTwitter": "dataSMTwitter", "dataOtherText": "--", "dataDomain": "dataDomainPolitics", "dataDomainOtherText": "--", "resourcesDict": "resourcesDict", "resourcesOtherText": "--", "resource": "resourceYes", "annotSizeText": "4800 Tweets", "annotSetup": "annotTrained", "annotViews": "annotViewsNo", "AnnotSchema": "AnnotSchemaNo", "IAA": "IAAYes", "annotIAATypeText": "MF; agreement for moral/non-moral categories", "annotIAAScoreText": "0.723; 0.636", "annotIAAMetricText": "Cohen's Kappa", "AnnotErrAnalysis": "AnnotErrAnalysisNo", "AnnotResourceAvailable": "AnnotResourceAvailableYes", "AnnotResourceAvailableYesURL": "https://osf.io/wqzmj/files/osfstorage#", "AnnotResourceAvailablePartlyURL": "--", "experiment": "experimentYes", "featML": "featML", "expTransformerText": "--", "expLlmText": "--", "semiMLText": "--", "unsuperMLText": "--", "expOtherText": "--", "ExpErrAnalysis": "ExpErrAnalysisRudimentary", "replicTrainTest": "replicTrainTestYes", "replicGold": "replicGoldClear", "analysis": "analysisYes", "analysisField": "analysisFieldPolitics", "analysisFieldOtherText": "--", "analysisType": "analysisExplore", "dataAvail": "dataAvailYes", "dataYesUrlText": "https://osf.io/wqzmj/files/osfstorage#", "dataYesCommentText": "Only IDs for Tweets", "dataPartlyUrlText": "--", "replicPreproc": "replicPreprocAmbig", "replicCode": "replicCodeYes", "replicCodeText": "https://osf.io/wqzmj/files/osfstorage#", "validationAnnotation": "validationAnnotation", "validationCorrelation": "validationCorrelation", "validationOtherText": "--"}}
