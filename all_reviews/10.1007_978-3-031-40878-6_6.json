This is the main reason behind many approaches focusing on local post-hoc explanations recently proposed by the XAI community. However, a thorough comparison among available explainability techniques is currently missing, mainly for the lack of a general metric to measure their benefits.", "paperContributionText": "The authors introduce a framework which compares state-of-the-art local post-hoc explanation mechanisms for models trained over moral value classification tasks based on a measure of correlation.", "paperResultsText": "The experiments show how most local post-hoc explainers are loosely correlated, and highlight huge discrepancies in their results\u2014their \u201cquarrel\u201d about explanations. In addition, the authors compare the impact scores distribution obtained from each local posthoc explainer with human-made dictionaries, and point out that there is no correlation between explanation outputs and the concepts humans consider as salient.", "theoryMFT": "theoryMFT", "numMF": "numMF10", "theoryOtherText": "--", "theoryOwnText": "--", "definition": "definitionVague", "unitDocument": "unitDocument", "goalAI": "goalAI", "langEn": "langEn", "langOther": "--", "dataSM": "dataSM", "dataSMTwitter": "dataSMTwitter", "dataOtherText": "--", "dataDomain": "dataDomainPolitics", "dataDomainOtherText": "--", "resourcesDict": "resourcesDict", "resourcesMFTC": "resourcesMFTC", "resourcesOtherText": "--", "annotSizeText": "--", "annotIAATypeText": "--", "annotIAAScoreText": "--", "annotIAAMetricText": "--", "AnnotResourceAvailableYesURL": "--", "AnnotResourceAvailablePartlyURL": "--", "resource": "resourceNo", "experiment": "experimentYes", "expTransformers": "expTransformers", "expTransformerText": "BERT", "semiMLText": "--", "unsuperMLText": "--", "expOtherText": "--", "ExpErrAnalysis": "ExpErrAnalysisYes", "replicTrainTest": "replicTrainTestAmbig", "replicGold": "replicGoldClear", "analysis": "analysisYes", "analysisField": "analysisFieldPolitics", "analysisFieldOtherText": "--", "analysisType": "analysisExplore", "dataYesUrlText": "--", "dataYesCommentText": "--", "dataPartlyUrlText": "--", "dataAvail": "dataAvailNotRelevant", "replicPreproc": "replicPreprocClear", "replicCodeText": "--", "replicCode": "replicCodeNotRelevant", "validationAnnotation": "validationAnnotation", "validationCorrelation": "validationCorrelation", "validationOtherText": "--"}}
