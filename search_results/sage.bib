abstract = {Research has shown that accounting for moral sentiment in natural language can yield insight into a variety of on- and off-line phenomena such as message diffusion, protest dynamics, and social distancing. However, measuring moral sentiment in natural language is challenging, and the difficulty of this task is exacerbated by the limited availability of annotated data. To address this issue, we introduce the Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus, a collection of 35,108 tweets that have been curated from seven distinct domains of discourse and hand annotated by at least three trained annotators for 10 categories of moral sentiment. To facilitate investigations of annotator response dynamics, we also provide psychological and demographic metadata for each annotator. Finally, we report moral sentiment classification baselines for this corpus using a range of popular methodologies.}

abstract = {Moral expressions in online communications can have a serious impact on framing discussions and subsequent online behaviours. Despite research on extracting moral sentiment from English text, other low-resource languages, such as Persian, lack enough resources and research about this important topic. We address this issue using the Moral Foundation theory (MFT) as the theoretical moral psychology paradigm. We developed a Twitter data set of 8000 tweets that are manually annotated for moral foundations and also we established a baseline for computing moral sentiment from Persian text. We evaluate a plethora of state-of-the-art machine learning models, both rule-based and neural, including distributed dictionary representation (DDR), long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT). Our findings show that among different models, fine-tuning a pre-trained Persian BERT language model with a linear network as the classifier yields the best results. Furthermore, we analysed this model to find out which layer of the model contributes most to this superior accuracy. We also proposed an alternative transformer-based model that yields competitive results to the BERT model despite its lower size and faster inference time. The proposed model can be used as a tool for analysing moral sentiment and framing in Persian texts for downstream social and psychological studies. We also hope our work provides some resources for further enhancing the methods for computing moral sentiment in Persian text.}

abstract = {In this paper we present a computational text analysis technique for measuring the moral loading of concepts as they are used in a corpus. This method is especially useful for the study of online corpora as it allows for the rapid analysis of moral rhetoric in texts such as blogs and tweets as events unfold. We use latent semantic analysis to compute the semantic similarity between concepts and moral keywords taken from the \^{a} Moral foundation Dictionary\^{a} . This measure of semantic similarity represents the loading of these concepts on the five moral dimensions identified by moral foundation theory. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method using three different concepts and corpora.},

abstract = {The study aimed to examine whether the use of words related to different moral foundations can predict the perceived severity of research misconduct. We gave two groups of participants, undergraduate medical students, the same hypothetical scenarios of research misconduct cases containing words related to different aspects of morality, and asked them to assess how inappropriate the described behavior was. Students ranked the described behaviors differently by the inappropriateness of the behavior, but the group wording was not a significant predictor of appropriateness. The reasons for the ranking were not related to any standardized procedures for research integrity but were related to the moral assessment of the students, which was assessed using qualitative approach. The results of this study implicate that personal moral views are an important part in research integrity training.}

abstract = {In this article, we take a queer linguistics approach to the analysis of data from British newspaper articles that discuss the introduction of same-sex marriage. Drawing on methods from critical discourse analysis (CDA) and corpus linguistics, we focus on the construction of agency in relation to the government extending marriage to same-sex couples, and those resisting this. We show that opponents to same-sex marriage are represented and represent themselves as victims whose moral values, traditions and civil liberties are being threatened by the state. Specifically, we argue that victimhood is invoked in a way that both enables and permits discourses of implicit homophobia.}
