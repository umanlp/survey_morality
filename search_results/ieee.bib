  abstract={Understanding moral foundations can yield powerful results in terms of perceiving the intended meaning of the text data, as the concept of morality provides additional information on the unobservable characteristics of information processing and non-conscious cognitive processes. Considering that moral values vary significantly across cultures and yet many recurrent themes are observed and that each culture builds its societal and ideological narratives on top of its moral virtues, an enhanced understanding of morality can prove to be a valuable tool in deterring disinformation narratives by adversaries. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of latent moral loadings over time and across different sub-narratives on human and bot-generated tweets. For this purpose, we analyze the Syrian White Helmets-related tweets from April 1st, 2018 to April 30th, 2019. For the operationalization and quantification of moral rhetoric in tweets, we use Moral Foundations Dictionary in which five psychological dimensions (Harm/Care, Subversion/Authority, Cheating/Fairness, Betrayal/Loyalty and Degradation/Purity) are considered. Our results present the significant differences between the strength and patterns of moral rhetoric for human and bot-generated content on Twitter.},

  abstract={The Moral Foundations Theory defines foundations to explain human moral reasoning and its role in the decision-making process, including how information is perceived and interpreted. A problem related to aspects of moral values that is currently gaining notoriety is the spread of false information known as "Fake News". Natural language processing techniques are being used in social sciences studies to deal with the Fake News detection task. This work introduces and brings details from the development of MFD-BR, a Brazilian Portuguese lexicon based on the Moral Foundations Theory, designed to measure Moral Sentiment in texts. It also contributes to Fake News detection strategies by assessing the difference in moral dimensions to distinguish between reliable sources texts and texts originated from low-reputation sources (considered by fact-checking agencies).},

  title={Mental representation of morality: The endorsement pattern of moral foundations among Iranians}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={72-76},
  abstract={Rooted in the intuitionist approach to moral judgment, Moral Foundations Theory provides a reasonable coverage of moral concerns. It assumes a pluralistic first draft to the moral mind which develops under the influence of the environment and leads to cross-cultural differences in judgment of right and wrong. This study examines the mental representations of Iranians regarding morality using MFT as the framework. Participants were 172 Iranian adults. Their views on ideal society, and immoral and moral behaviors were obtained using open-ended questions which provided three different contexts to evoke morality-related conceptions. Responses were divided up into chunks and each chunk was categorized as belonging to moral foundations. A repeated measures analysis of variance was carried out with frequency of reference to foundations as the dependent variable being predicted by two within-subjects factors of question and moral foundation. Fairness, care, and sanctity were found to be the most salient moral foundations, whereas liberty and loyalty ranked last. Moreover, the interaction of question and foundation was significant. The pattern of Iranians' endorsement of foundations seems to be a blend of Western and Eastern moral profiles. The results also suggest that the pattern of reference to foundations was sensitive to semantic context. Notably, liberty, which is the recent addition to the list of moral foundations, was more easily evoked in the context of views on ideal society than within the context of questions on moral and immoral behaviors.},

This is a particularly challenging problem because moral values are often only implicitly signaled in language, and tweets contain little contextual information due to length constraints. To address these obstacles, we present a novel approach to automatically acquire background knowledge from an external knowledge base to enrich input texts and thus improve moral value prediction. By combining basic textual features with background knowledge, our overall context-aware framework achieves performance comparable to a single human annotator. Our approach obtains 13.3% absolute F -score gains compared to our baseline model that only uses textual features.},

  abstract={The popularity of current communication technologies has boosted the spread of polarization and radical ideologies, which can be exploited by terrorist organizations. Building upon previous research, this work focuses on the task of automatic radicalization detection in texts using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. In this way, we investigate the effectiveness of integrating moral values through the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Moral values play a crucial role in identifying ideological inclinations and can have a significant impact on the radicalization detection task. Our approach distinguishes itself in the feature extraction stage, leveraging moral values, emotions, and similarity-based features that utilize word embeddings. Additionally, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed representations with three distinct datasets that model radicalization and use the SHAP method to gain relevant insight into the models’ reasoning.},

  abstract={Moral inclinations expressed in user-generated content such as online reviews can provide useful insight to understand and predict people's rating behavior. In this work, we extracted a corpus of over 7,000 online reviews on Yelp that express moral concerns, and associated them to five moral factors defined in Moral Foundations Theory using the Doc2Vec natural language processing technique. We compared the rating distributions between the regular reviewers and the moral-concerned reviewers, and found that their rating patterns significantly differ from each other. Our findings also indicate that people with moral concerns tend to rate lower if a moral foundation is violated. Moreover, among the five moral factors, purity is the most distinctive moral foundation.},

  abstract={Moral foundations theory explains variations in moral behavior using innate moral foundations: Care, Fairness, Ingroup, Authority, and Purity, along with experimental supports. However, little is known about the roles of and relationships between those foundations in everyday moral situations. To address these, we quantify moral foundations from a large amount of online conversations (tweets) about moral topics on the social media site Twitter. We measure moral loadings using latent semantic analysis of tweets related to topics on abortion, homosexuality, immigration, religion, and immorality in general, showing how the five moral foundations function in spontaneous conversations about moral violating situations. The results indicate that although the five foundations are mutually related, Purity is the most distinctive foundation and Care is the most dominant foundation in everyday conversations on immorality. Our study shows a new possibility of natural language processing and social big data for moral psychology.},

  pages={79-85},
  abstract={In today's modern society, many parents are busy building a successful career and it is very common that there are many young families with both parents working. Hence, the young children of such families will be placed in day-care centres or they are looked after by their grandparents and maids. Working parents would not be spending much quality time with their children and providing them with moral guidance. This group of children, if not given adequate and proper guidance, would not know much about good moral values. There are also children who grow up around people who do not practise good moral values and commit all types of wrongdoings such as cheating, stealing, bullying, being selfish, greedy, uncaring and ill-treating animals. It is easy for children to be influenced by such actions and behaviours. Therefore, this research plans to assist in imparting moral values to children by using the concept of “edutainment” with the use of a mobile application. Based on the results collected in this research, the application is fully functional without any bugs because all the respondents who took part in the testing of the application were able to launch the application on their mobile phones successfully. The results also show that the mobile application is well received by both parents and the children and it has been effective in helping children aged 4 to 9 to have a better understanding of moral values.},

  abstract={Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that have recently gained significant popularity, particularly in the digital art sector. The success of NFTs and other blockchain-based innovations depends on their ac-acceptance and use by consumers. This study aims to understand the impact of moral values on the acceptance of NFTs. Based on a quantitative survey with over 800 complete responses, the analysis shows that moral aspects of NFTs are indeed important for potential users. However, there is an attitude-behavior gap, as the positive impact of moral values on the intention to use NFTs is not reflected in the actual current usage of NFTs by the respondents. This study contributes to knowledge by providing new empirical data on the acceptance of NFTs and highlighting the role of moral values on the acceptance decision.},

  pages={1657-1663},
  abstract={Moral sentiment has been hypothesized to reflect evolved adaptations to social living. If so, individual differences in moral values may relate to regional variation in brain structure. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 70 young, healthy adults examining whether differences on two major dimensions of moral values were significantly associated with regional gray matter volume. The two clusters of moral values assessed were “individualizing” (values of harm/care and fairness) and “binding” (deference to authority, in-group loyalty, and purity/sanctity). Individualizing was positively associated with left dorsomedial pFC volume and negatively associated with bilateral precuneus volume. For binding, a significant positive association was found for bilateral subcallosal gyrus and a trend to significance for the left anterior insula volume. These findings demonstrate that variation in moral sentiment reflects individual differences in brain structure and suggest a biological basis for moral sentiment, distributed across multiple brain regions.},

  pages={147-154},
  abstract={Morality plays an important role in culture, identity, and emotion. Recent advances in natural language processing have shown that it is possible to classify moral values expressed in text at scale. Morality classification relies on human annotators to label the moral expressions in text, which provides training data to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, these annotations are inherently subjective and some of the instances are hard to classify, resulting in noisy annotations due to error or lack of agreement. The presence of noise in training data harms the classifier's ability to accurately recognize moral foundations from text. We propose two metrics to audit the noise of annotations. The first metric is entropy of instance labels, which is a proxy measure of annotator disagreement about how the instance should be labeled. The second metric is the silhouette coefficient of a label assigned by an annotator to an instance. This metric leverages the idea that instances with the same label should have similar latent representations, and deviations from collective judgments are indicative of errors. Our experiments on three widely used moral foundations datasets show that removing noisy annotations based on the proposed metrics improves classification performance.11Our code can be found at: https://github.com/negar-mokhberian/noise-audits.},

  abstract={In the political debate on Autonomous Weapon Systems strong views and opinions are voiced, but empirical research to support these opinions is lacking. Insight into which moral values are related to the deployment of Autonomous Weapon Systems is missing. We describe the empirical results of two studies on moral values regarding Autonomous Weapon Systems that aim to understand the perception of people pertaining to the introduction of Autonomous Weapon Systems. One study consists of a sample of military personnel of the Dutch Ministry of Defense and the second study contains a sample of civilians. The results indicate both groups are more anxious about the deployment of Autonomous Weapon Systems than about the deployment of Human Operated drones, and that they perceive Autonomous Weapon Systems to have less respect for the dignity of human life. The concerns for Autonomous Weapon Systems creating new kinds of psychological and moral harm is very present in the public debate, and this is in our opinion one element that deserves to be carefully considered in future debates on the ethics of the design and deployment of Autonomous Weapon Systems. The results of these studies reveal a common ground regarding the moral values of human dignity and anxiety pertaining the introduction of Autonomous Weapon Systems which could further the ethical debate.},

  year={2011},
  volume={23},
  number={9},
  pages={2103-2116},
  abstract={Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory is an influential scientific account of morality incorporating psychological, developmental, and evolutionary perspectives. The theory proposes that morality is built upon five innate “foundations,” each of which is believed to have been selected for during human evolution and, subsequently, tuned-up by learning during development. We argue here that although some general elements of Haidt's theory are plausible, many other important aspects of his account are seriously flawed. First, innateness and modularity figure centrally in Haidt's account, but terminological and conceptual problems foster confusion and ambiguities. Second, both the theory's proposed number of moral foundations and its taxonomy of the moral domain appear contrived, ignoring equally good candidate foundations and the possibility of substantial intergroup differences in the foundations' contents. Third, the mechanisms (viz., modules) and categorical distinctions (viz., between foundations) proposed by the theory are not consilient with discoveries in contemporary neuroscience concerning the organization, functioning, and development of the brain. In light of these difficulties, we suggest that Haidt's theory is inadequate as a scientific account of morality. Nevertheless, the theory's weaknesses are instructive, and hence, criticism may be useful to psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers attempting to advance theories of morality, as well as to researchers wishing to invoke concepts such as innateness and modularity more generally.},

To our knowledge, no studies thus far have addressed this perspective in considering the moral values within this robotic domain. However, their values could conflict with the values upheld by other relevant stakeholders, such as the values of teachers, parents or children. Hence, it is crucial to take the various perspectives of relevant stakeholder's moral values into account. For this study, multiple focus group sessions (n=3) were conducted in The Netherlands with representatives (n=13) of robotic companies on their views of robots in primary education. Their perceptions in terms of opportunities and concerns, were then linked to business values reported in the extant literature. Results show that out of 26 business values, mainly six business values appeared relevant for robot tutors: 1) profitability, 2) productivity, 3 & 4) innovation and creativity, 5) competitiveness, and 6) risk orientation organization..},

  abstract={Engineering ethics education is taking on increasing importance worldwide, but in Chile the percentage of universities that have a mandatory course concerning ethics is still small. Traditionally, Chilean universities with existing ethics courses teach them using a philosophical or theological perspective, limited to occidental theories, and usually from a Christian point of view. This article studies the impact of a new methodology and technique to teach ethics in Chile: case-based, non-normative, and with a critical-descriptive approach. An empirical study is conducted to assess the relative impact of an ethics class on students individual and inherent moral values and attitudes, and understand the factors that contribute to this impact. Results indicate that even though the importance of religion in Chile is decreasing, it is still a major source of students' ethical principles and moral values. In addition, results suggest that a change in moral values develops when discussions among groups with different points of view occur.},

  abstract={This cross-cultural comparison of approximately 600 youth in China and 600 youth in the U.S. focused on the moral values, acceptability of a variety of morally questionable online behaviors, and the relationship between moral values and acceptability of online behaviors. Findings indicated differences both in moral values and in behaviors that Chinese and U.S. youth believed were acceptable in the virtual world. Chinese youth found more behaviors acceptable than did U.S. youth, with the exception of videogame violence, which U.S. youth found more acceptable. The value placed on peer approval predicted the acceptability of morally questionable online behaviors, suggesting that a peer culture supporting such behaviors may account for their acceptability among Chinese youth. Educational interventions designed to reduce morally questionable online behaviors by taking cultural values into account are discussed, as is the need for additional research to establish a link between beliefs about acceptability and actual online behaviors.},

  abstract={Based on the beliefs that human life and pregnancy begin at conception, that human life has equal moral value regardless of its development stage or form, and that emergency contraception (EC) has mechanisms of action that may induce abortion, Catholic health care facilities are not permitted to provide EC to rape victims if any possibility exists that a woman may have conceived due to her rape, even if that possibility is unverifiable. The Catholic Church claims that the mechanism of action of EC is uncertain and that some studies have concluded that disruption of implantation, which the Church considers to be abortion, may occur. Drawing on insights from feminist epistemology (e.g. work by Helen Longino) and arguments at the intersection of bioethics and philosophy of science (including work by Robert Veatch and Grant Gillett), we argue that the Church's position on this matter is based on uncertain (and misinterpreted) scientific claims and that particular normative (moral and theological) commitments on the part of those wielding power over Church Law lead to a weighing of probabilities in a manner consonant with the preservation of that power. In this paper, we examine how normative commitments infuse or infect the assessment of probability and influence ethical policy. We also examine how probabilism, a moral method that operates within the constraints of Catholic normative commitments, offers an alternative approach which respects, acknowledges, and maximizes an individual's ability to determine probable reason for moral action in the face of irreducible uncertainty.},

  abstract={Engineering ethics education is taking on increasing importance due to globalization, where current and new global issues need to be addressed with both technologies and values. In particular, multiculturalism is part of the process of globalization, and that can be seen in U.S. universities whose students have different nationalities, ethnicities, and cultures. But we know very little about the impact engineering ethics education has on students' ethical values or attitudes and moreover, if diversity contributes to it. An empirical study is conducted to first, assess the relative impact of an ethics class in student's individual and inherent moral values, and second, to determine if demographic characteristics of the students as individuals and as a group contributes to this impact. An initial Schwartz value profile of each student was obtained at the beginning of the semester and compared to their after-class value profile. This study concludes the team interaction among members of multicultural teams is the main contributor influencing moral values.},

  abstract={The ability of rational agents to work in a team is one of their special characteristics that can help achieve their shared goals. However, in certain conditions, conflict may occur in an agent society; especially if there are selfish agents. A selfish agent places the achievement of its own goal as the main priority in its actions. To strike a balance between the achievement of an agent's own goal and its shared goal, strong moral values should be instilled in software agent environments. Sincerity is one strong human moral values that has been proven to bring many benefits to human society and reduce selfish attitude. By adapting human sincere behaviour, conflicts in software agent society could be mitigated. Sincerity behaviour can also influence a software agent to be more rational in its action and sensitive to its work environment. In our work, we study the situations in which software agents demonstrate sincere behavior in task performances. This paper proposes algorithms of sincere actions of rational agents when completing a given task.},

As a result, AI is expected to replace what considered to be done by human intelligence. Additionally, human societies are willing to accept AI agents as members to collaborate with. For AI agents to be successfully integrated into human societies, the agents must understand important values in the societies. Ethics is a system of values that sustain the societies and it is considered as the most important. Therefore, there should be a way for AI agents to understand ethical values of human societies. In this paper, we show how to extract ethical values and moral values of the age from news articles using natural language processing. Our result shows that from newspaper articles ethical and moral values could be extracted and modeled for AI agents to refer. In conclusion AI can calculated ethicality of text by itself. In the future, we can develop more ethical autonomous AI agents.},

  abstract={In today's digital age, technology has a firm grasp on practically every aspect of human life, consequently there is growing cross-sector demand to help individuals build digital competencies such as digital literacy, digital skills, and digital readiness. However, there is no universally accepted meaning of terms like “digital literacy,” “digital skills,” or “digital readiness,” which can lead to difficulty coordinating efforts to improve digital competencies worldwide. Digital Intelligence (DQ) was developed to encompass a comprehensive set of technical, cognitive, meta-cognitive, and socio-emotional competencies, which are grounded in universal moral values and enable individuals to face the challenges of digital life and adapt to its demands. The DQ Framework is comprised of 8 areas of digital life--identity, use, safety, security, emotional intelligence, literacy, communication, and rights--across 3 levels of experience--citizenship, creativity, and competitiveness. The objective of this standard is to establish a DQ global standard that encompasses a common framework to ensure that digital competency building efforts are coordinated globally. It includes a common set of definitions, language, and understanding of digital literacy, skills, and readiness that can be adopted by all stakeholders worldwide, including national governments, the educational industry, the technology industry, international agencies, private companies, and society as a whole.},

  abstract={As smart cities increasingly become real, an ethical framework for them becomes increasingly necessary. Surprisingly, current approaches largely disregard such a framework and concentrate primarily on challenges pertaining to the data lifecycle. However, a smart city involves much more than data gathering: it involves the interactions of residents, businesses, and government agencies with respect to public and private resources subject to potentially subtle regulations and other norms. This article introduces a sociotechnical view of smart cities and shows how it may be profitably mapped to the moral foundation theory to provide a comprehensive ethical framework.},

  abstract={Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup is one of the folk stories originating from Riau Province. This folk tale has a fairly good moral value to be conveyed to the next generation, which is to be kind, caring, and maintaining the mandate given by parents. The current generation, commonly referred to as Z generation, is not accustomed to reading books, this generation uses smartphones more often to access technology, while the folklore of Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup is mostly still in book form. This research raises the folklore of Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup using Augmented Reality technology, so the Z generation is interested in seeing and listening to this folk tale. This study uses Blender for making 3D animations and Kudan SDK libraries with markerless techniques for Augmented Reality and user interface uses Unity application and runs on the Android operating system. The Augmented Reality of Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup folklore concluded that the application can display 3D animated in dim light with the intensity of 30 lux light and the distance to display an object was at least 5 cm to 90 cm with an angle of 10-90 degrees. Based on user validation, 90% of respondents strongly agree that Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup folklore is made in the form of an Augmented Reality application.},

  abstract={In recent years, the social structure of our country has undergone tremendous changes, the moral value of people is gradually lost. As a group that has just become independent in society, the moral personality of college students is also facing severe challenges, so researchers need to re-study this issue. Research process: This paper takes the students of Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine as the research objects, and uses a self-designed questionnaire to investigate the moral personality of 117 college students, the subjects ranged from the first year of college to the third year of graduate school. This paper uses SPSS 26.0 statistical software to process and analyze data. The statistical analysis methods used included descriptive statistics, Spearman’s rank correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis. This paper firstly determines the current situation of moral personality of college students through descriptive statistical analysis method, and then discusses which factors are related to moral personality through the method of correlation analysis, and finally puts the factors determined in the previous step into the regression equation to determine this factor The degree of influence on the moral personality of college students. The significance of this research is to explore the current situation of college students’ moral personality, predict the degree of influence of ideological and political education courses and other factors on college students’ moral personality, and conduct practical research on the ways and methods of college students’ moral personality training.},

  volume={},

  pages={4337-4340},
  abstract={In bioengineering training for new researchers and engineers, a great deal of time is spent discussing what constitutes “good” design. Conceptualization of good design, however, varies widely across interdisciplinary team members, with potential to both foster innovation or lead to unproductive conflict. To explore how groups central to bioengineering teams (physicians/clinicians and engineers/physicists) conceptualize good design, we asked 176 professionals in bioengineering to complete a comprehensive online survey including items designed to assess cognitive and moral foundations (validated MFQ30 tool) and custom items assessing perceptions on good design in three areas (good design characteristics, reputation of design approvers, and perceived design patient/consumer suitability). Of those that responded, 82 completed all quantitative survey sections and were included in this preliminary analysis. Correlations between response areas were examined to explore the possible links between cognitive and moral biases and perspectives on good design. The survey results indicated that both groups were more conservative than average Americans based on previous reports, and clinicians scored higher on average for all MFQ30 domains. Numerous significant correlations with good design were observed among clinicians, while engineers/physicists most closely correlated good design with prescriber approval and scientific/technical literature. The exploratory analysis demonstrated the potential utility of sociological frameworks to explore relationships in design thinking with potential utility to stimulate thriving conversation on team-based design thinking in bioengineering education and practice.},

  abstract={At first glance ethics and technology seem to have no interaction. However, we see the influence of ethics on technology both from the profession and the public. For example the “code of professional ethics” has changed the procedures in different parts of science, engineering and technology, and has given a particular direction to the types of projects done, their scope, and implementations. The sensitivity of consumers to choose moral values has also resulted in the change of direction for many technologies. Public participation in science and technology and the legal channels are the other factors that shape the influence of ethics on technology. More controversially on the other side we see the impact of technology on ethics. One can argue how and why some of the most abstract ideas like normative ethical theories or Kantian ethics have been reactions to the advancements in science and technology. Additionally, the effects of technological change have greatly influenced modern relativistic ethics. Technology has provided new possibilities for human life and created new ethical questions too. In a sense, "applied ethics" is the product of technological development. A different view of the ethics of science and technology is discussed and analyzed in this paper.},

With thisadvancement people need to be aware of theseveral ethical, privacy and security issues associated with the new technology.Ethics in simple words means moral principles. Ethics in information technology means taking decisions about using these technologies based on moral values and knowledge of what is “right” or “wrong”.Information technology is the key technology used for development of smart driverless cars. These cars aim to reduce human errors and prevent road accidents from taking place. Every year 1.25 million people die in road accidents, of these 94 percent of accidents are caused by human errors which can be prevented using the driverless cars.However, these cars need to be programmed and there are cases where the program will have to make moral decisions on the road. These decisions can vary from causing a minor accident to prevent a major one to deciding whose safety is more important pedestrians or passengers. In this paper we will discuss about some experiments being done on driverless cars, the benefits and the challenges in the development of this new IT technology-driverless cars.},

  abstract={Story telling is a process of conveying events by words, images and sounds. It has been used in every culture as a means of entertainment, education or for instilling moral values. The power of story telling has now been realized by computer science and software engineering community. It has been argued that story telling will enable the actual requirement to be identified earlier in the software development process. This approach has also been identified as one of the most suitable approach for end-user software development. A number of software development environment based on story telling approach have been developed, such as Storytelling Alice and JPie. Storytelling Alice is a programming environment that enables end-users (in this case students) to create computer applications by creating short 3D animated movies. JPie is a programming environment that was designed to enable end-users to develop programs by using Java programming language. In this paper, we describe the design of a story telling approach for blocks integration in Block-Based Software Development Environment. A block is basically a single-layer software component that can perform a specific function. It is assumed that in this environment, there will be a large number of blocks to be used by the end-users through story telling approach. End-users can develop applications by writing instructions for selecting, customizing and combining software blocks to form a learning application as target application.},

  abstract={This paper arose from a research project conducted to develop an interactive multimedia package for fostering the cultivation of moral sentiments using traditional Malay oral narratives called CITRA, which is presented and described herein. This project was carried out taking advantage of new and emerging information technologies. CITRA, which uses the CD-ROM and computer as the means of dissemination, is a didactic tool that comprises of four strictly interrelated learning modules: (i) storytelling world module, (ii) enjoyable reading world module, (iii) word enrichment corner, and (iv) mind test land module that consists of moral values appreciation test and application test, which focus on the presentation and evaluation of moral knowledge. The design and development of CITRA was made using the experience from other interactive multimedia applications, as well as referred to education and Malay literature specialists. The principle objective of this project is to create a didactic tool that uses different communications mediums within a single computer program, which allows the positive images of stories to be projected and can foster good moral sense in children. The paper also discusses the findings of the research, which indicates that the use of CITRA is significantly more effective as compared to the use of conventional instruction method in projecting positive values and images of narratives for assisting in moral education teaching learning.},

  abstract={Social control theory argues that religious people would stick to the ethical codes of religion. The theory further asserts that religion would have tremendous effects on individuals' moral attitudes and behavior. This study tests social control theory. Data were collected from a sample of 911 people who were 18 or older at the time of study. The analysis reveals that Protestants have stronger moral values, are less corrupted, volunteer more for community service, and have better concerns for others than atheists. These differences, although significant statistically, are not so great. Religious activities such as church attendance, family worship, and participation in church activities have small effects on the Protestants' attitudes toward violence, and reasonable effects on voluntary service. Various religiosity indices have reasonable and consistent effects on the Protestants' attitudes toward marital fidelity and violence and on some of the moral behaviors in a positive way. The effects of religion on the Protestants' morality are, however, not as great as social control theory predicts.},

  abstract={The development in education in the 21st century has demanded Malaysian students to be on par or better with other students in advanced countries. Various pedagogics of teaching and learning are introduced in the class in order to produce good students in thinking, technical and moral values skills. One of the pedagogics introduced is using robotic education in the Malaysian education system. Among the advantages of robotic education are students can play in the learning process, can use ICT, problem solving, reasoning and working in teams. It was introduced in the education system particularly in the primary and secondary school education in 2005 by the Ministry of Education of Malaysia as a co-curricular activity which later is expanded as a competition from schools, districts, and states, national to international levels. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of robotic education in enhancing learning process among students. Quantitative approach by using questionnaires method to thirty selected students is employed. The result indicated that many students agreed that robotic education is required and relevant in enhancing learning process among students. It provides an interesting and positive learning environment where students are exposed various teaching and learning activities in the classroom where the students have to conduct experiments to get answers for each question which different from conventional learning activity of memorization and writing. As a conclusion, robotic education would entice students' to learn by themself besides that can help to improve students thinking skills.},

  abstract={There are several types of institutions which provide private Quran instruction in Turkey. The most prevail of institutions are Imam-Hatip High Schools and private Quran courses. Also, after the changes in educational system in 2012, optional Quran courses have been made available to all students in elementary schools. In addition, there is a mandatory course entitled Religious Culture and Moral Education in schools. However, teaching Quran is not a part of course content. Rather, it aims to teach individuals cultural, religious, and moral values. Also, within this course, students are required to learn short surahs and duas for prayer and their Turkish meanings. However, while teaching/learning these surahs and duas, teachers and students face many difficulties. Specifically, students who do not know Arabic have to memorize those surahs and duas that are written by using letters from Latin Alphabet, which causes incorrect readings phonetically. Also, this course is given two hours per week, thus, it is difficult for teachers to focus on each student and correct mis-readings. In this study, based on the problems mentioned above, an instructional material was designed to help students learn short surahs and duas for prayer. Elementary school students' development level and features of interactive whiteboards were considered while designing the software. The software consists of three levels. The first level aims to teach students surahs and duas in Arabic by listening and watching. The second level focuses on their meanings. The third level is devoted for sustainability through practices. Students who get to the third level have to answer some filling-the-gap and drag & drop questions, matching the meanings with surahs/duas, and similar activities.},

Six possible benchmarks are considered: autonomy, imitation, intrinsic moral value, moral accountability, privacy, and reciprocity. Finally, we discuss how getting the right group of benchmarks in human-robot interaction will, in future years, help inform on the foundational question of what constitutes essential features of being human},

  abstract={In the age of social media, where billions of internet users share information and opinions, the negative impact of pandemics is not limited to the physical world. It provokes a surge of incomplete, biased, and incorrect information, also known as an infodemic. This global infodemic jeopardizes measures to control the pandemic by creating panic, vaccine hesitancy, and fragmented social response. Platforms like Facebook allow advertisers to adapt their messaging to target different demographics and help alleviate or exacerbate the infodemic problem depending on their content. In this paper, we propose a minimally supervised multi-task learning framework for understanding messaging on Facebook related to the COVID vaccine by identifying ad themes and moral foundations. Furthermore, we perform a more nuanced thematic analysis of messaging tactics of vaccine campaigns on social media so that policymakers can make better decisions on pandemic control.},

  year={2015},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={This paper presents results from engineering student responses to the open ended question “Write a few sentences explaining how you define `Social Responsibility'.” Through emergent coding methods it was found that students were most likely to use a disassociated, third person voice in their definitions, as opposed to a first person voice where they included themselves in the group that help the responsibility. The responsibility that students talked about was most commonly held toward a general community or society, and occasionally toward the environment or the world as a whole. In describing how the responsibility manifested itself, students talked most often about giving back or helping others, but also about a responsibility to conduct acts of service or charity. Finally, students infrequently directly cited a source of the responsibility, though some described ethical or moral foundations while others talked about an obligation due to possessing certain skills or privileges. Few differences were found in these definitions based on gender, academic rank, or major. Understanding how engineering student's view their social responsibility as both citizen and engineer is crucial towards shaping educational approaches to develop holistic engineers, able to work across disciplinary and cultural divides toward solutions of complex social issues.},

  abstract={This full research paper develops a framework for using comparative case studies to triangulate with quantitative survey data in engineering ethics education research.Ethics has long been recognized as crucial to responsible engineering, but the increasingly globalized environments of contemporary engineering present challenges to effective engineering ethics training. An overarching goal of our team’s larger project is to examine the effects of culture and education on ethics training in undergraduate engineering students at universities in the United States, China, and the Netherlands to assess how this training impacts students’ ethical reasoning and moral dispositions, and how this differs cross-culturally. To gauge students’ moral dispositions and ethical reasoning skills and to measure any change in these, we administer the Moral Foundations Questionnaire and the Engineering & Science Issues Test to engineering students longitudinally over four years. Because the conditions related to engineering ethics education differ widely per participating institution, interpreting and analyzing survey quantitative data will require understanding the contextual conditions of education at each institution. In this paper we ask the question what and how can case study methods contribute to longitudinal and cross-cultural ethics educational research with large data sets? To answer it, we develop conceptual and methodological foundations for the design of comparative, multi-institutional case studies to contextualize, complement, and interpret quantitative and qualitative data on ethical reasoning and moral dispositions. We develop comparative case studies to supply missing contextual information for triangulation with quantitative and qualitative data and to provide a more complete picture of the engineering ethics educational contexts, strategies, and practices at each of the participating universities. In this project, case studies provide informational and contextual significance to the other sources of data our research produces, elucidating conditions required to understand and make sense of the results of the research. In the paper we introduce our research project, motivate the use of case studies in our research by reviewing literature on case studies and multi-method triangulation in educational research. We explain how specific cases will be designed, and by providing the first step of two cases, timelines of ethics interventions for two degree programs, demonstrate the informational and interpretive need for comparative case studies in triangulating with other data sources. By using multiple case design to compare universities’ approaches in this frame, our analysis can respond to particular institutional educational contexts and cultural and language factors, make cross-cultural comparisons, and offer recommendations about responsible and culturally responsive engineering ethics education.},

  abstract={To address the requirement for autonomous moral decision making, we introduce a software library for modeling hybrid ethical reasoning agents (short: HERA). The goal of the HERA project is to provide theoretically well-founded and practically usable logic-based machine ethics tools for implementation in robots. The novelty is that HERA implements multiple ethical principles like utilitarianism, the principle of double effect, and a Pareto-inspired principle. These principles can be used to automatically assess moral situations represented in a format we call causal agency models. We discuss how to model moral situations using our approach, and how it can cope with uncertainty about moral values. Finally, we briefly outline the architecture of our robot IMMANUEL, which implements HERA and is able to explain ethical decisions to humans.},

  year={2019},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Ethics education is a requirement in undergraduate engineering education, but evidence suggests that there is a limited improvement, and perhaps even diminishment, in moral commitments and capacities in engineering students during college. In the present paper, we gauge the current state of ethics education and identify opportunities for improvement given current trends in teaching ethics in engineering. We find that engineering ethics education has a number of suboptimal characteristics. First, engineering ethics does not show clear links to varying ethical theories that might inform ethical reasoning and decision making. Second, engineering ethics education places a heavy emphasis on compliance or rule-following, which provides fewer opportunities for internalizing moral values and virtues. Third, ethics lessons often emphasize case studies of rare or extreme circumstances, like the NASA space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986, reinforcing the perception that morality is an infrequent professional concern. In the interest of improving ethics education, we introduce character education as a valuable approach to undergraduate engineering ethics education, one grounded in philosophical and psychological work on developing virtuous dispositions as well as personal, professional, and societal flourishing. We describe what character education in engineering might look like and sketch how it could help the profession and its stakeholders achieve both personal and professional outcomes.},

The areas examined were freedom in research, impartiality, suspension of judgment until sufficient evidence is at hand, absence of bias, diffusion of information, and group loyalty. Two dimensions of creativity were measured in the respondents: rate of publication and strength of motivation toward research as judged by peers. Neither of these measures was significantly related to acceptance of the classical position in any of the six areas of value. It is concluded that the classical morality of science is not associated to any important degree with productive research.},

  abstract={Social robots are increasingly studied and applied in the educational domain. Although they hold great potential for education, they also bring new moral challenges. In this study, we explored the moral considerations related to social robots from the perspective of Dutch educational policymakers by first identifying opportunities and concerns and then mapping them onto (moral) values from the literature. To explore their moral considerations, we conducted focus group sessions with Dutch Educational Policymakers (N = 20). Considerations varied from the potential to lower the workload of teachers, to concerns related to the increased influence of commercial enterprises on the educational system. In total, the considerations of the policymakers related to 15 theoretical values. We identified the moral considerations of educational policymakers to gain a better understanding of a governmental attitude towards the use of social robots. This helps to create the necessary moral guidelines towards a responsible implementation of social robots in education.},

  abstract={Increasingly, humanitarian organizations across the globe have been implementing innovative technologies in their practice as they respond to the needs of communities affected by conflicts, disasters, and public health emergencies. However, technological innovation may intersect with moral values, norms, and commitments, and may challenge humanitarian imperatives. Through the examination of an empirical case study on drone mapping, this paper aims to explore three questions: (1) What are the dynamics between aid delivery and technological innovation in the humanitarian enterprise? (2) How are structural problems addressed in an environment in which technology is being portrayed as a force for change? (3) What moral responsibilities towards vulnerable populations should humanitarian stakeholders bear when introducing innovative technologies in humanitarian action. Discussion revolves around the ideology of “technological utopia”, and the normative role of technology in the aid sector - to make substantive impacts, or to produce “success stories”. In conclusion, a call for rigorous ethical analysis to help foster value sensitive humanitarian innovation (VSHI) is made.},

The greed for materialistic and worldly things is increasing. The trend can be partially contributed to the modern education system, where total emphasis is on domain and technical knowledge. Teaching of moral values is considered as an integral part of the education in Islam. The contents of our formal education syllabi are gradually throwing out material on character development. With the busy schedule of individuals, the role of character development by the family and society is diminishing. The only hope is left with the teacher. In the e-Learning platform that hope is also disappearing because of physical absence of teacher. The work will analyze the learning models and role of ethical development. It is also proposing a model using ICTs which can help in the character development of the students in the e-Learning environments.},

  abstract={An ethical leader is one whose actions and influence processes are consistent with ethical and moral values. Research indicates the effect of the leaders' values on the ethical choices they make. Ethical leadership percolates down to shape the ethical attitudes of people at lower levels, thereby setting the ethical climate of the organization. This paper identifies the imperative for ethical leadership and the manner in which it is manifested in universities and research organizations in India, and suggests an ethical leadership framework for academic and research administrators. The central argument of this paper is that the leader's own value system, attitudes and influence strategies shape employee behavior and set the ethical tone of the organization. This paper is based on literature review and in-depth exploratory interviews with 26 key informants including institutional leaders and members of the top management and middle-level management in four universities and two research organizations in north India. The first part of our ethical leadership framework includes the dimensions of ethical leadership, while the latter part incorporates the outcomes of ethical leadership. The dimensions of ethical leadership include value orientation, attitudes and influence strategies of the leader. The outcomes of ethical leadership are discussed at three levels of organizational behavior, namely, the individual (micro), the work group (meso) and the organization (macro). This paper recommends strategies for research and education planners, policy makers and administrators to build ethical leadership amongst researchers and academics.},

  abstract={Storytelling is a way to represent events using words, images and sounds, often by improvisation. Stories or narratives have been shared in all cultures as a way to entertain, educate, for cultural preservation and as a way to transmit moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling are the plot, the characters and the narrative point of view. Currently there are several languages and tools that allow the creation of virtual worlds, and however, few tools for creating 3D storytelling. Existing approaches are not intuitive and require a deeper knowledge of the user to enable the creation of virtual worlds with higher quality graphics, enabling the integration of customized multimedia presentations. This paper presents a solution for interactive storytelling, targeted to children and juvenile public, called Mogre-Storytelling. This tool claims to be intuitive, providing different functionalities for the creation and customization of scenarios in 3D, allowing the addition of 3D models from the Internet and even enabling the creation of virtual story using multimedia and storytelling elements such as speech bubbles, sounds and images. Mogre- Storytelling is a new option for users who want to create stories with scenarios in 3D and is an alternative to Ogre application developers, since this tool enables the rapid creation of customized scenarios with higher quality 3D graphics, while still allowing the integration of multimedia presentations using an XML file structure.},

  abstract={During ancient Indian times, the Gurukul system of education was the style of learning in the country. In this system the students were learning with their mentors (Gurus) and receiving education, knowledge, moral values and life skills under the guidance of their gurus. This system of education was practiced in ancient times, where all students who resided at the place of the guru in the Gurukula were considered equal. As the days passed the things took a drastic change and government schools were introduced. A few decades ago, the number of students in government schools decreased due to the privatization of the education system. Later, more schools were introduced by corporations, which led to a significant increase in the number of schools. To perform the tasks like monitoring and taking the attendance of each class was tedious job at the same time it was time consuming, where the total number of students in each class has increased and number of subjects for each class also increased and every teacher has to document the number of students attending the classes for each subject and they need to submit it to the higher authorities. To overcome these difficulties, In this paper a novel approach is schemed to record attendance of all the students of a class. In the proposed system to take the attendance of the students all at once, a live video is processed for each frame and to recognize the faces of all the students it uses a deep convolutional neural network face recognition algorithm which extract 128-dimensional face encodings from images and then compares these encodings with the faces stored in the dataset to determine the best match and further the attendance of the students present in the class is recorded in the form of excel sheet so that the teacher can carry out the further analysis. The findings of the experiment overcomes the difficulties faced in the existing systems and eyewitnesses the furturistic transition in marking attendance.},

  abstract={With the advent of new digital media and low cost computers which are connected to each other, the educational system needs better ways of teaching children. Recently, games on computers and other digital media are being explored as a possible medium of imparting education. The existing games however are either developed for entertainment purposes only or have a limited focus in aiding the children learn according to the existing curriculum. This paper describes our attempt at combining story-telling with collaborative game-play to achieve better learning with FoodForce2. FoodForce2 is an attempt which aims at providing a holistic view towards learning by inculcating moral values and other cognitive skills. The effect of imparting education through this interactive platform is compared with the conventional methods of teaching and the feedback and results obtained from various school visits have been documented in the form of graphs.},

  abstract={In today’s digital age, technology has a firm grasp on practically every aspect of human life, consequently there is growing cross-sector demand to help individuals build digital competencies such as digital literacy, digital skills, and digital readiness. However, there is no universally accepted meaning of terms like “digital literacy,” “digital skills,” or “digital readiness,” which can lead to difficulty coordinating efforts to improve digital competencies worldwide. Digital Intelligence (DQ) was developed to encompass a comprehensive set of technical, cognitive, meta-cognitive, and socio-emotional competencies, which are grounded in universal moral values and enable individuals to face the challenges of digital life and adapt to its demands. The DQ Framework is comprised of 8 areas of digital life--identity, use, safety, security, emotional intelligence, literacy, communication, and rights--across 3 levels of experience--citizenship, creativity, and competitiveness. The objective of this standard is to establish a DQ global standard that encompasses a common framework to ensure that digital competency building efforts are coordinated globally. It includes a common set of definitions, language, and understanding of digital literacy, skills, and readiness that can be adopted by all stakeholders worldwide, including national governments, the educational industry, the technology industry, international agencies, private companies, and society as a whole.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has the capability of making decisions in real-time using well-before techniques and computer technologies built through data analysis to instantly adapt and learn to provide more complex actions to circumstances. Human resource management (HRM), which incorporates both the human aspect and the use of AI tools, can provide employees with a better perception. The component of HRM decision-making by AI technologies has not been hindered by a restricted awareness of the theoretical underpinnings of AI integration; however, the enhanced usage of artificial intelligence and advancements in AI qualities have put a greater emphasis on the moral values and administrators influencing AI development for using Data-driven forecasting have been suggested for HRM to use to forecast employee desires and revenue growth. The emphasis on decision-making in AI technologies is abruptly shifting to strategies. Machine learning concentrates on enabling computers to make logical conclusions by educating them to adapt to shifts in innovation or to new knowledge. While ML is an enhanced form of AI that analyses data to find similarities and alters program action steps, AI simplifies and converts data into a format that is simple to grasp. It emphasizes the development of Algorithms that will enhance HR choices by utilizing machine learning to create precise forecasts.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={137-144},
  abstract={The aim of this paper is to explore, using an original procedure, social signals of listening occurring during interactions involving adolescents and their teachers. This procedure is based on a game simulation played out by dyads composed either of one adult and one adolescent or of two adolescents. A pilot study using this procedure has been conducted in an educational setting, since listening detection may be seen as a basic competence for successful scaffolding interactions, by which adults not only enhance but also orient adolescents' development. Among the different data resulting from our pilot study, in this paper we focus our attention on multimodal annotation schemata relating to adolescents' nodding when listening to their teachers expressing their personal judgments on some moral dilemmas - assuming that the capacity to take a stance on moral values is one of the main developmental tasks adolescents have to cope with. Although widely recognized -- starting from the classic work of Darwin on the expressions of emotions in man and animals -- as a social signal of acceptance of the other's message, in our pilot study nodding proved at times to be a signal that the adolescents weren't comprehending the words of their teachers at all. Selected examples of multimodal observations are presented of features characterizing adult-adolescent interactions when this specific kind of nodding without understanding occurs. In the final part of the paper, limitations of this procedure are discussed. Finally, a perspective for future works is presented.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The prevalence of adult content on social media has harmful effects on the moral values of young individuals. Therefore, effectively filtering inappropriate content on social media like Twitter is essential. Researchers have utilized machine learning and natural language processing techniques to develop automated systems that can identify adult content. However, using Transformer to detect adult content in the Indonesian language has yet to be thoroughly explored. Identifying adult content in a text is relatively challenging due to its subjective and context-dependent nature. The same words can be used in explicit or non-explicit contexts depending on the context or intended meaning of the surrounding text. This study aims to explore the implementation of fine-tuned Transformer-based models for identifying adult and sexually explicit content in Indonesian Twitter texts. We fine-tuned five pre-trained Transformer-based models: IndoBERT, IndoBERTweet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and DistilmBERT. Based on our experiments, we can see that all the models showed effectiveness in accurately classifying adult and non-adult content. Among the Transformer-based models, XLM-RoBERTa and IndoBERTweet demonstrated effective adult content identification in Indonesian tweets compared to other pre-trained models. XLM-RoBERTa showed a slightly better performance, which can be attributed to its larger size and advanced training techniques.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},

  pages={161-183},
  abstract={To the City Beautiful movement, the commercialization of light expressed an individualistic social fragmentation that adherents worked to overcome by holding expositions, building public libraries, opening parks, establishing museums, and creating other uplifting institutions that would put all social classes on an equal footing. In such public spaces, lighting could make knowledge, culture, and entertainment accessible to all. City Beautiful proponents were disturbed by the commercialization of urban public space. As Peter Baldwin notes, the new white ways were “buzzing with energy and barely suppressed eroticism.” Reformers such as Jane Addams feared that such districts might overwhelm the still-undeveloped sensibilities of adolescents. The new “urban night was not an extension of day; it was a liminal new world in which conflicting moral values mingled uneasily [and] … heightened the excitement of the nighttime street.”1 Most people still did not have electricity at home, and the brilliant, pulsating lights of downtown were an alluring contrast to domestic space, even if reformers thought it garish. Houses and apartments began to seem dim, especially if invaded by light from the street. Reformers also objected to the skyscraper because it blocked sunlight, created powerful winds, and disrupted the human scale of the city. Such views prevailed in Boston, where few tall buildings were erected before 1920. Reformers disliked large (especially flashing) advertising signs. They believed that “the individual has no more right to offend the public's eye with flaunting self-assertiveness than to offend its ear with crashing sounds or the nostrils with unpleasant odors.”2 They were pleased that there existed a “British Society for Checking the Abuses of Public Advertising,” and that there were strict controls on posters in Paris and many other European cities.3 They applauded when Berlin issued “stringent regulations as to the number, size and height” of electric signs, and further restricted “flash signs” on the grounds that they were injurious to the eyes and a dangerous distraction to traffic.4 And they objected to the fragmentation and incoherence of US public space, and hoped through planning to recover a sense of cohesion, order, and civility.},

  title={The Ethics of Mandatory Exoskeleton Use in Commercial and Industrial Settings}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Research shows exoskeletons can reduce muscle activity and decrease the risk of injury for workers. Exoskeletons, therefore, are becoming more prevalent in industrial workplaces, and their use in some circumstances has already been mandated. It is probable that additional employers will mandate the use of exoskeletons as a means of mitigating injuries to their employees. This presents ethical concerns because employers hold power over the employees wages and employment. Some employees who are required to wear exoskeletons may not be able to, while others may not wish to. How should workers privacy and preferences be weighted? Should employees be prohibited from jobs that use exoskeletons if the exoskeletons do not fit them or if they do not wish to disclose their bodys measurements? Should companies using exoskeletons be permitted to require workers to perform additional work with an exoskeleton? In this paper, we examine these and other ethical considerations related to mandatory exoskeleton use through the Six Pillars of Character framework of the Josephson Institute of Ethics (2002) and the Universal Moral Values for Corporate Codes of Ethics framework by Schwartz (2005). We provide a discussion of possible solutions following ethical tenets, including executing pilot studies before mandatory use policies, offering several self-adjustable models of exoskeletons, and allowing existing workers to transfer jobs if they are ill at ease with new exoskeleton policies. The best course of action may depend on specific individual circumstances.},
