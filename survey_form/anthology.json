      "abstract": "The expression of opinions, stances, and moral foundations on social media often coincide with toxic, divisive, or inflammatory language that can make constructive discourse across communities difficult. Natural language generation methods could provide a means to reframe or reword such expressions in a way that fosters more civil discourse, yet current Large Language Model (LLM) methods tend towards language that is too generic or formal to seem authentic for social media discussions. We present preliminary work on training LLMs to maintain authenticity while presenting a community{'}s ideas and values in a constructive, non-toxic manner.",

      "abstract": "Identifying expressions of human values in textual data is a crucial albeit complicated challenge, not least because ethics are highly variable, often implicit, and transcend circumstance. Opinions, arguments, and the like are generally founded upon more than one guiding principle, which are not necessarily independent. As such, little is known about how to classify and predict moral undertones in natural language sequences. Here, we describe and present a solution to ValueEval, our shared contribution to SemEval 2023 Task 4. Our research design focuses on investigating chain classifier architectures with pretrained contextualized embeddings to detect 20 different human values in written arguments. We show that our best model substantially surpasses the classification performance of the baseline method established in prior work. We discuss limitations to our approach and outline promising directions for future work.",

      "abstract": "Much work in natural language processing (NLP) relies on human annotation. The majority of this implicitly assumes that annotator{'}s labels are temporally stable, although the reality is that human judgements are rarely consistent over time. As a subjective annotation task, hate speech labels depend on annotator{'}s emotional and moral reactions to the language used to convey the message. Studies in Cognitive Science reveal a {`}foreign language effect{'}, whereby people take differing moral positions and perceive offensive phrases to be weaker in their second languages. Does this affect annotations as well? We conduct an experiment to investigate the impacts of (1) time and (2) different language conditions (English and German) on measurements of intra-annotator agreement in a hate speech labelling task. While we do not observe the expected lower stability in the different language condition, we find that overall agreement is significantly lower than is implicitly assumed in annotation tasks, which has important implications for dataset reproducibility in NLP.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we focus on the task of determining the public attitude toward various social issues discussed on social media platforms. Platforms such as Twitter, however, are often used to spread misinformation, fake news through polarizing views. Existing literature suggests that higher levels of toxicity prevalent in Twitter conversations often spread negativity and delay addressing issues. Further, the embedded moral values and speech acts specifying the intention of the tweet correlate with public opinions expressed on various topics. However, previous works, which mainly focus on stance detection, either ignore the speech act, toxic, and moral features of these tweets that can collectively help capture public opinion or lack an efficient architecture that can detect the attitudes across targets. Therefore, in our work, we focus on the main task of stance detection by exploiting the toxicity, morality, and speech act as auxiliary tasks. We propose a multitasking model TWISTED that initially extracts the valence, arousal, and dominance aspects hidden in the tweets and injects the emotional sense into the embedded text followed by an efficient attention framework to correctly detect the tweet{'}s stance by using the shared features of toxicity, morality, and speech acts present in the tweet. Extensive experiments conducted on 4 benchmark stance detection datasets (SemEval-2016, P-Stance, COVID19-Stance, and ClimateChange) comprising different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.",

Among other topics, researchers focused on the notion of morality, investigating, for example, which moral judgements language models make. However, there has been little to no discussion of the terminology and the theories underpinning those efforts and their implications. This lack is highly problematic, as it hides the works{'} underlying assumptions and hinders a thorough and targeted scientific debate of morality in NLP. In this work, we address this research gap by (a) providing an overview of some important ethical concepts stemming from philosophy and (b) systematically surveying the existing literature on moral NLP w.r.t. their philosophical foundation, terminology, and data basis. For instance, we analyse what ethical theory an approach is based on, how this decision is justified, and what implications it entails. Our findings surveying 92 papers show that, for instance, most papers neither provide a clear definition of the terms they use nor adhere to definitions from philosophy. Finally, (c) we give three recommendations for future research in the field. We hope our work will lead to a more informed, careful, and sound discussion of morality in language technology.",

      "abstract": "Moral or ethical judgments rely heavily on the specific contexts in which they occur. Understanding varying shades of defeasible contextualizations (i.e., additional information that strengthens or attenuates the moral acceptability of an action) is critical to accurately represent the subtlety and intricacy of grounded human moral judgment in real-life scenarios. We introduce defeasible moral reasoning: a task to provide grounded contexts that make an action more or less morally acceptable, along with commonsense rationales that justify the reasoning. To elicit high-quality task data, we take an iterative self-distillation approach that starts from a small amount of unstructured seed knowledge from GPT-3 and then alternates between (1) self-distillation from student models; (2) targeted filtering with a critic model trained by human judgment (to boost validity) and NLI (to boost diversity); (3) self-imitation learning (to amplify the desired data quality). This process yields a student model that produces defeasible contexts with improved validity, diversity, and defeasibility. From this model we distill a high-quality dataset, $\\delta$-Rules-of-Thumb, of 1.2M entries of contextualizations and rationales for 115K defeasible moral actions rated highly by human annotators 85.9{\\%} to 99.8{\\%} of the time.

We develop a framework that integrates moral dilemmas with moral principles pertaining to different foramlisms of normative ethics, and at different levels of abstractions.

However, PMLMs are trained on varying amounts of data for each language. In practice this means their performance is often much better on English than many other languages. We explore to what extent this also applies to moral norms. Do the models capture moral norms from English and impose them on other languages? Do the models exhibit random and thus potentially harmful beliefs in certain languages? Both these issues could negatively impact cross-lingual transfer and potentially lead to harmful outcomes. In this paper, we (1) apply the MORALDIRECTION framework to multilingual models, comparing results in German, Czech, Arabic, Chinese, and English, (2) analyse model behaviour on filtered parallel subtitles corpora, and (3) apply the models to a Moral Foundations Questionnaire, comparing with human responses from different countries. Our experiments demonstrate that, indeed, PMLMs encode differing moral biases, but these do not necessarily correspond to cultural differences or commonalities in human opinions.

      "abstract": "Automatic response forecasting for news media plays a crucial role in enabling content producers to efficiently predict the impact of news releases and prevent unexpected negative outcomes such as social conflict and moral injury. To effectively forecast responses, it is essential to develop measures that leverage the social dynamics and contextual information surrounding individuals, especially in cases where explicit profiles or historical actions of the users are limited (referred to as lurkers). As shown in a previous study, 97{\\%} of all tweets are produced by only the most active 25{\\%} of users. However, existing approaches have limited exploration of how to best process and utilize these important features. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, named SocialSense, that leverages a large language model to induce a belief-centered graph on top of an existent social network, along with graph-based propagation to capture social dynamics. We hypothesize that the induced graph that bridges the gap between distant users who share similar beliefs allows the model to effectively capture the response patterns. Our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art in experimental evaluations for both zero-shot and supervised settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in response forecasting. Moreover, the analysis reveals the framework{'}s capability to effectively handle unseen user and lurker scenarios, further highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.",

Using insights from social psychology, we craft a framework that operationalizes empathic similarity in terms of three key features of stories: main events, emotional trajectories, and overall morals or takeaways. We create EmpathicStories, a dataset of 1,500 personal stories annotated with our empathic similarity features, and 2,000 pairs of stories annotated with empathic similarity scores. Using our dataset, we fine-tune a model to compute empathic similarity of story pairs, and show that this outperforms semantic similarity models on automated correlation and retrieval metrics. Through a user study with 150 participants, we also assess the effect our model has on retrieving stories that users empathize with, compared to naive semantic similarity-based retrieval, and find that participants empathized significantly more with stories retrieved by our model. Our work has strong implications for the use of empathy-aware models to foster human connection and empathy between people.",

      "abstract": "This work focuses on the spatial dimension of narrative understanding and presents the task of event-location tracking in narrative texts. The task intends to extract the sequence of locations where the narrative is set through its progression. We present several architectures for the task that seeks to model the global structure of the sequence, with varying levels of context awareness. We compare these methods to several baselines, including the use of strong methods applied over narrow contexts. We also develop methods for the generation of location embeddings and show that learning to predict a sequence of continuous embeddings, rather than a string of locations, is advantageous in terms of performance. We focus on the test case of Holocaust survivor testimonies. We argue for the moral and historical importance of studying this dataset in computational means and that it provides a unique case of a large set of narratives with a relatively restricted set of location trajectories. Our results show that models that are aware of the larger context of the narrative can generate more accurate location chains. We further corroborate the effectiveness of our methods by showing similar trends from experiments on an additional domain.",

Humanoid Agents are able to use these dynamic elements to adapt their daily activities and conversations with other agents, as supported with empirical experiments. Our system is designed to be extensible to various settings, three of which we demonstrate, as well as to other elements influencing human behavior (e.g. empathy, moral values and cultural background). Our platform also includes a Unity WebGL game interface for visualization and an interactive analytics dashboard to show agent statuses over time.

We present a new task, Response Forecasting on Personas for News Media, to estimate the response a persona (characterizing an individual or a group) might have upon seeing a news message. Compared to the previous efforts which only predict generic comments to news, the proposed task not only introduces personalization in the modeling but also predicts the sentiment polarity and intensity of each response. This enables more accurate and comprehensive inference on the mental state of the persona. Meanwhile, the generated sentiment dimensions make the evaluation and application more reliable. We create the first benchmark dataset, which consists of 13,357 responses to 3,847 news headlines from Twitter. We further evaluate the SOTA neural language models with our dataset. The empirical results suggest that the included persona attributes are helpful for the performance of all response dimensions. Our analysis shows that the best-performing models are capable of predicting responses that are consistent with the personas, and as a byproduct, the task formulation also enables many interesting applications in the analysis of social network groups and their opinions, such as the discovery of extreme opinion groups.",

      "abstract": "Moral norms vary across cultures. A recent line of work suggests that English large language models contain human-like moral biases, but these studies typically do not examine moral variation in a diverse cultural setting. We investigate the extent to which monolingual English language models contain knowledge about moral norms in different countries. We consider two levels of analysis: 1) whether language models capture fine-grained moral variation across countries over a variety of topics such as {``}homosexuality{''} and {``}divorce{''}; 2) whether language models capture cultural diversity and shared tendencies in which topics people around the globe tend to diverge or agree on in their moral judgment. We perform our analyses with two public datasets from the World Values Survey (across 55 countries) and PEW global surveys (across 40 countries) on morality. We find that pre-trained English language models predict empirical moral norms across countries worse than the English moral norms reported previously. However, fine-tuning language models on the survey data improves inference across countries at the expense of a less accurate estimate of the English moral norms. We discuss the relevance and challenges of incorporating cultural knowledge into the automated inference of moral norms.",

A moral dialogue system aligned with users{'} values could enhance conversation engagement and user connections. In this paper, we propose a framework, MoralDial to train and evaluate moral dialogue systems. In our framework, we first explore the communication mechanisms of morality and resolve expressed morality into three parts, which indicate the roadmap for building a moral dialogue system. Based on that, we design a simple yet effective method: constructing moral discussions between simulated specific users and the dialogue system. The constructed discussions consist of expressing, explaining, revising, and inferring moral views in dialogue exchanges, which makes conversational models learn morality well in a natural manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel evaluation method under the framework. We evaluate the multiple aspects of morality by judging the relation between dialogue responses and human values in discussions, where the multifaceted nature of morality is particularly considered. Automatic and manual experiments demonstrate that our framework is promising to train and evaluate moral dialogue systems.",

We posit that questions whose potential answers lead to \\textit{diverging} moral judgments are the most informative. Thus, we propose a reinforcement learning framework with a defeasibility reward that aims to maximize the divergence between moral judgments of hypothetical answers to a question. Human evaluation demonstrates that our system generates more relevant, informative and defeasible questions compared to competitive baselines. Our work is ultimately inspired by studies in cognitive science that have investigated the flexibility in moral cognition (i.e., the diverse contexts in which moral rules can be bent), and we hope that research in this direction can assist both cognitive and computational investigations of moral judgments.",

In this paper, we study few-shot identification of a psycho-linguistic concept, Morality Frames (Roy et al., 2021), using LLMs. Morality frames are a representation framework that provides a holistic view of the moral sentiment expressed in text, identifying the relevant moral foundation (Haidt and Graham, 2007) and at a finer level of granularity, the moral sentiment expressed towards the entities mentioned in the text. Previous studies relied on human annotation to identify morality frames in text which is expensive.

Combating the outcomes of this infodemic is not only a question of identifying false claims, but also reasoning about the decisions individuals make. In this work we propose a holistic analysis framework connecting stance and reason analysis, and fine-grained entity level moral sentiment analysis. We study how to model the dependencies between the different level of analysis and incorporate human insights into the learning process. Experiments show that our framework provides reliable predictions even in the low-supervision settings.",

We introduce the GALAD (Game-value ALignment through Action Distillation) agent that uses the social commonsense knowledge present in specially trained language models to contextually restrict its action space to only those actions that are aligned with socially beneficial values. An experimental study shows that the GALAD agent makes decisions efficiently enough to improve state-of-the-art task performance by 4{\\%} while reducing the frequency of socially harmful behaviors by 25{\\%} compared to strong contemporary value alignment approaches.",

This paper studies whether state-of-the-art, pre-trained language models are capable of passing moral judgments on posts retrieved from a popular Reddit user board. Reddit is a social discussion website and forum where posts are promoted by users through a voting system. In this work, we construct a dataset that can be used for moral judgement tasks by collecting data from the AITA? (Am I the A*******?) subreddit. To model our task, we harnessed the power of pre-trained language models, including BERT, RoBERTa, RoBERTa-large, ALBERT and Longformer. We then fine-tuned these models and evaluated their ability to predict the correct verdict as judged by users for each post in the datasets. RoBERTa showed relative improvements across the three datasets, exhibiting a rate of 87{\\%} accuracy and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.76, while the use of the Longformer model slightly improved the performance when used with longer sequences, achieving 87{\\%} accuracy and 0.77 MCC.",

Recognizing PCL is challenging because of its subtle nature, because available datasets are limited in size, and because this task often relies on some form of commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we study to what extent PCL detection models can be improved by pre-training them on other, more established NLP tasks. We find that performance gains are indeed possible in this way, in particular when pre-training on tasks focusing on sentiment, harmful language and commonsense morality. In contrast, for tasks focusing on political speech and social justice, no or only very small improvements were witnessed. These findings improve our understanding of the nature of PCL.",

      "abstract": "Although current large-scale generative language models (LMs) can show impressive insights about factual knowledge, they do not exhibit similar success with respect to human values judgements (e.g., whether or not the generations of an LM are moral). Existing methods learn human values either by directly mimicking the behavior of human data, or rigidly constraining the generation space to human-chosen tokens. These methods are inherently limited in that they do not consider the contextual and abstract nature of human values and as a result often fail when dealing with out-of-domain context or sophisticated and abstract human values. This paper proposes SENSEI, a new reinforcement learning based method that can embed human values judgements into each step of language generation. SENSEI deploys an Actor-Critic framework, where the Critic is a reward distributor that simulates the reward assignment procedure of humans, while the Actor guides the generation towards the maximum reward direction. Compared with five existing methods in three human values alignment datasets, SENSEI not only achieves higher alignment performance in terms of both automatic and human evaluations, but also shows improvements on robustness and transfer learning on unseen human values.",

Identifying human moral values is essential for artificially intelligent agents to co-exist with humans. Recent progress in natural language processing allows the identification of moral values in textual discourse. However, domain-specific moral rhetoric poses challenges for transferring knowledge from one domain to another. We provide the first extensive investigation on the effects of cross-domain classification of moral values from text. We compare a state-of-the-art deep learning model (BERT) in seven domains and four cross-domain settings. We show that a value classifier can generalize and transfer knowledge to novel domains, but it can introduce catastrophic forgetting. We also highlight the typical classification errors in cross-domain value classification and compare the model predictions to the annotators agreement. Our results provide insights to computer and social scientists that seek to identify moral rhetoric specific to a domain of discourse.",

A key contribution is the combination of semi-automatic resource building for extraction of domain-dependent concern types (with 2-4 hours of human labor per domain) and an entirely automatic procedure for extraction of domain-independent moral dimensions and endorsement values. Prudent (automatic) selection of terms from propositional structures for lexical expansion (via semantic similarity) produces new moral dimension lexicons at three levels of granularity beyond a strong baseline lexicon. We develop a ground truth (GT) based on expert annotators and compare our concern detection output to GT, to yield 231{\\%} improvement in recall over baseline, with only a 10{\\%} loss in precision. F1 yields 66{\\%} improvement over baseline and 97.8{\\%} of human performance. Our lexically based approach yields large savings over approaches that employ costly human labor and model building.

      "abstract": "Moral values as commonsense norms shape our everyday individual and community behavior. The possibility to extract moral attitude rapidly from natural language is an appealing perspective that would enable a deeper understanding of social interaction dynamics and the individual cognitive and behavioral dimension. In this work we focus on detecting moral content from natural language and we test our methods on a corpus of tweets previously labeled as containing moral values or violations, according to Moral Foundation Theory. We develop and compare two different approaches: (i) a frame-based symbolic value detector based on knowledge graphs and (ii) a zero-shot machine learning model fine-tuned on a task of Natural Language Inference (NLI) and a task of emotion detection. The final outcome from our work consists in two approaches meant to perform without the need for prior training process on a moral value detection task.",

      "abstract": "Most works on computational morality focus on moral polarity recognition, i.e., distinguishing right from wrong. However, a discrete polarity label is not informative enough to reflect morality as it does not contain any degree or intensity information. Existing approaches to compute moral intensity are limited to word-level measurement and heavily rely on human labelling. In this paper, we propose MoralScore, a weakly-supervised framework that can automatically measure moral intensity from text. It only needs moral polarity labels, which are more robust and easier to acquire. Besides, the framework can capture latent moral information not only from words but also from sentence-level semantics which can provide a more comprehensive measurement. To evaluate the performance of our method, we introduce a set of evaluation metrics and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that our method achieves good performance on both automatic and human evaluations.",

      "abstract": "Conversational agents have come increasingly closer to human competence in open-domain dialogue settings; however, such models can reflect insensitive, hurtful, or entirely incoherent viewpoints that erode a user{'}s trust in the moral integrity of the system. Moral deviations are difficult to mitigate because moral judgments are not universal, and there may be multiple competing judgments that apply to a situation simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a new resource, not to authoritatively resolve moral ambiguities, but instead to facilitate systematic understanding of the intuitions, values and moral judgments reflected in the utterances of dialogue systems. The Moral Integrity Corpus, MIC, is such a resource, which captures the moral assumptions of 38k prompt-reply pairs, using 99k distinct Rules of Thumb (RoTs). Each RoT reflects a particular moral conviction that can explain why a chatbot{'}s reply may appear acceptable or problematic. We further organize RoTs with a set of 9 moral and social attributes and benchmark performance for attribute classification. Most importantly, we show that current neural language models can automatically generate new RoTs that reasonably describe previously unseen interactions, but they still struggle with certain scenarios. Our findings suggest that MIC will be a useful resource for understanding and language models{'} implicit moral assumptions and flexibly benchmarking the integrity of conversational agents.

At issue here are not just individual systems and datasets, but also the AI tasks themselves. In this position paper, I make a case for thinking about ethical considerations not just at the level of individual models and datasets, but also at the level of AI tasks. I will present a new form of such an effort, Ethics Sheets for AI Tasks, dedicated to fleshing out the assumptions and ethical considerations hidden in how a task is commonly framed and in the choices we make regarding the data, method, and evaluation. I will also present a template for ethics sheets with 50 ethical considerations, using the task of emotion recognition as a running example. Ethics sheets are a mechanism to engage with and document ethical considerations before building datasets and systems. Similar to survey articles, a small number of carefully created ethics sheets can serve numerous researchers and developers.",

We present a novel unsupervised framework for tracing textual sources of moral change toward entities through time. We characterize moral change with probabilistic topical distributions and infer the source text that exerts prominent influence on the moral time course. We evaluate our framework on a diverse set of data ranging from social media to news articles. We show that our framework not only captures fine-grained human moral judgments, but also identifies coherent source topics of moral change triggered by historical events.

For artificial systems to be fully integrated into social environments, adherence to such norms is a central prerequisite. To investigate whether language generation models can serve as behavioral priors for systems deployed in social settings, we evaluate their ability to generate action descriptions that achieve predefined goals under normative constraints. Moreover, we examine if models can anticipate likely consequences of actions that either observe or violate known norms, or explain why certain actions are preferable by generating relevant norm hypotheses. For this purpose, we introduce Moral Stories, a crowd-sourced dataset of structured, branching narratives for the study of grounded, goal-oriented social reasoning. Finally, we propose decoding strategies that combine multiple expert models to significantly improve the quality of generated actions, consequences, and norms compared to strong baselines.",

      "abstract": "Entity framing is the selection of aspects of an entity to promote a particular viewpoint towards that entity. We investigate entity framing of political figures through the use of names and titles in German online discourse, enhancing current research in entity framing through titling and naming that concentrates on English only. We collect tweets that mention prominent German politicians and annotate them for stance. We find that the formality of naming in these tweets correlates positively with their stance. This confirms sociolinguistic observations that naming and titling can have a status-indicating function and suggests that this function is dominant in German tweets mentioning political figures. We also find that this status-indicating function is much weaker in tweets from users that are politically left-leaning than in tweets by right-leaning users. This is in line with observations from moral psychology that left-leaning and right-leaning users assign different importance to maintaining social hierarchies.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we analyze the use of modal verbs in a corpus of texts related to the vaccination debate. Broadly speaking, the vaccination debate centers around whether vaccination is safe, and whether it is morally acceptable to enforce mandatory vaccination. In order to successfully intervene and curb the spread of preventable diseases due to low vaccination rates, health practitioners need to be adequately informed on public perception of the safety and necessity of vaccines. Public perception can relate to the strength of conviction that an individual may have towards a proposition (e.g. {`}one must vaccinate{'} versus {`}one should vaccinate{'}), as well as qualify the type of proposition, be it related to morality ({`}government should not interfere in my personal choice{'}) or related to possibility ({`}too many vaccines at once could hurt my child{'}). Text mining and analysis of modal auxiliaries are economically viable means of gaining insights into these perspectives, particularly on a large scale due to the widespread use of social media and blogs as vehicles of communication.",

      "abstract": "Social norms{---}the unspoken commonsense rules about acceptable social behavior{---}are crucial in understanding the underlying causes and intents of people{'}s actions in narratives. For example, underlying an action such as {``}wanting to call cops on my neighbor{''} are social norms that inform our conduct, such as {``}It is expected that you report crimes.{''} We present SOCIAL CHEMISTRY, a new conceptual formalism to study people{'}s everyday social norms and moral judgments over a rich spectrum of real life situations described in natural language. We introduce SOCIAL-CHEM-101, a large-scale corpus that catalogs 292k rules-of-thumb such as {``}It is rude to run a blender at 5am{''} as the basic conceptual units. Each rule-of-thumb is further broken down with 12 different dimensions of people{'}s judgments, including social judgments of good and bad, moral foundations, expected cultural pressure, and assumed legality, which together amount to over 4.5 million annotations of categorical labels and free-text descriptions. Comprehensive empirical results based on state-of-the-art neural models demonstrate that computational modeling of social norms is a promising research direction. Our model framework, Neural Norm Transformer, learns and generalizes SOCIAL-CHEM-101 to successfully reason about previously unseen situations, generating relevant (and potentially novel) attribute-aware social rules-of-thumb.",

We focused primarily on Task A, which aimed to predict suicide risk, as rated by a team of expert clinicians (Shing et al., 2018), based on language used in SuicideWatch posts on Reddit. Category-level findings highlight the potential importance of social and moral language categories. Word-level correlates of risk levels underline the value of fine-grained data-driven approaches, revealing both theory-consistent and potentially novel correlates of suicide risk that may motivate future research.",

      "abstract": "Political discourse on social media microblogs, specifically Twitter, has become an undeniable part of mainstream U.S. politics. Given the length constraint of tweets, politicians must carefully word their statements to ensure their message is understood by their intended audience. This constraint often eliminates the context of the tweet, making automatic analysis of social media political discourse a difficult task. To overcome this challenge, we propose simultaneous modeling of high-level abstractions of political language, such as political slogans and framing strategies, with abstractions of how politicians behave on Twitter. These behavioral abstractions can be further leveraged as forms of supervision in order to increase prediction accuracy, while reducing the burden of annotation. In this work, we use Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) to build relational models to capture the similarities in language and behavior that obfuscate political messages on Twitter. When combined, these descriptors reveal the moral foundations underlying the discourse of U.S. politicians online, \\textit{across} differing governing administrations, showing how party talking points remain cohesive or change over time.",

We assume that people{'}s backgrounds, culture, and values are associated with their perceptions and expressions of everyday topics, and that people{'}s language use reflects these perceptions. While personal values and social effects are abstract and complex concepts, they have practical implications and are relevant for a wide range of NLP applications. To extract human values (in this paper, morality) and measure social effects (morality and stance), we empirically evaluate the usage of a morality lexicon that we expanded via a quality controlled, human in the loop process. As a result, we enhanced the Moral Foundations Dictionary in size (from 324 to 4,636 syntactically disambiguated entries) and scope. We used both lexica for feature-based and deep learning classification (SVM, RF, and LSTM) to test their usefulness for measuring social effects. We find that the enhancement of the original lexicon led to measurable improvements in prediction accuracy for the selected NLP tasks.",

And how did the public react to the demise of hitchBOT? Our analyses indicate that while there were few cross-cultural differences in sentiment towards hitchBOT, there was a significant negative emotional reaction to its destruction, suggesting that people had formed an emotional connection with hitchBOT and perceived its destruction as morally wrong.

Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals{'} demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation.

This paper aims at constructing the Thirukkural Discourse Parser which finds the semantic relations in the Thirukkurals which can extract the hidden meaning in it and help in utilizing the same in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as, Summary Generation Systems, Information Retrieval (IR) Systems and Question Answering (QA) Systems. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) is one of the discourse theories, which is used in NLP to find the coherence between texts. This paper finds the relation within the Thriukkurals and the discourse structure is created using the Thirukkural Discourse Parser. The resultant discourse structure of Thirukkural can be indexed and further be used by Summary Generation Systems, IR Systems and QA Systems. This facilitates the end user to access Thirukkural on WWW and get benefited. This Thirukkural Discourse Parser has been tested with all 1330 Thirukurals using precision and recall.",

      "abstract": "Cyberbullying and cyberaggression are serious and widespread issues increasingly affecting Internet users. With the widespread of social media networks, bullying, once limited to particular places, can now occur anytime and anywhere. Cyberaggression refers to aggressive online behaviour that aims at harming other individuals, and involves rude, insulting, offensive, teasing or demoralising comments through online social media. Considering the dangerous consequences that cyberaggression has on its victims and its rapid spread amongst internet users (specially kids and teens), it is crucial to understand how cyberbullying occurs to prevent it from escalating. Given the massive information overload on the Web, there is an imperious need to develop intelligent techniques to automatically detect harmful content, which would allow the large-scale social media monitoring and early detection of undesired situations. This paper presents the Isistanitos{'}s approach for detecting aggressive content in multiple social media sites. The approach is based on combining Support Vector Machines and Recurrent Neural Network models for analysing a wide-range of character, word, word embeddings, sentiment and irony features. Results confirmed the difficulty of the task (particularly for detecting covert aggressions), showing the limitations of traditionally used features.",

      "abstract": "Previous works in computer science, as well as political and social science, have shown correlation in text between political ideologies and the moral foundations expressed within that text. Additional work has shown that policy frames, which are used by politicians to bias the public towards their stance on an issue, are also correlated with political ideology. Based on these associations, this work takes a first step towards modeling both the language and how politicians frame issues on Twitter, in order to predict the moral foundations that are used by politicians to express their stances on issues. The contributions of this work includes a dataset annotated for the moral foundations, annotation guidelines, and probabilistic graphical models which show the usefulness of jointly modeling abstract political slogans, as opposed to the unigrams of previous works, with policy frames for the prediction of the morality underlying political tweets.",

      "abstract": "Amidst growing concern over media manipulation, NLP attention has focused on overt strategies like censorship and {``}fake news{''}. Here, we draw on two concepts from political science literature to explore subtler strategies for government media manipulation: agenda-setting (selecting what topics to cover) and framing (deciding how topics are covered). We analyze 13 years (100K articles) of the Russian newspaper Izvestia and identify a strategy of distraction: articles mention the U.S. more frequently in the month directly following an economic downturn in Russia. We introduce embedding-based methods for cross-lingually projecting English frames to Russian, and discover that these articles emphasize U.S. moral failings and threats to the U.S. Our work offers new ways to identify subtle media manipulation strategies at the intersection of agenda-setting and framing.",

      "abstract": "In sources used in oral history research (such as interviews with eye witnesses), passages where the degree of personal emotional involvement is found to be high can be of particular interest, as these may give insight into how historical events were experienced, and what moral dilemmas and psychological or religious struggles were encountered. In a pilot study involving a large corpus of interview recordings with Dutch war veterans, we have investigated if it is possible to develop a method for automatically identifying those passages where the degree of personal emotional involvement is high. The method is based on the automatic detection of exceptionally large silences and filled pause segments (using Automatic Speech Recognition), and cues taken from specific n-grams. The first results appear to be encouraging enough for further elaboration of the method.",

We present a large scale study of news articles from partisan sources in the US across a variety of different issues. We first highlight that differences between sides exist by predicting the political leaning of articles of unseen political bias. Framing can be driven by different types of morality that each group values. We emphasize differences in framing of different news building on the moral foundations theory quantified using hand crafted lexicons. Our results show that partisan sources frame political issues differently both in terms of words usage and through the moral foundations they relate to.",

      "abstract": "The growth of social networking platforms has drawn a lot of attentions to the need for social computing. Social computing utilises human insights for computational tasks as well as design of systems that support social behaviours and interactions. One of the key aspects of social computing is the ability to attribute responsibility such as blame or praise to social events. This ability helps an intelligent entity account and understand other intelligent entities{'} social behaviours, and enriches both the social functionalities and cognitive aspects of intelligent agents. In this paper, we present an approach with a model for blame and praise detection in text. We build our model based on various theories of blame and include in our model features used by humans determining judgment such as moral agent causality, foreknowledge, intentionality and coercion. An annotated corpus has been created for the task of blame and praise detection from text. The experimental results show that while our model gives similar results compared to supervised classifiers on classifying text as blame, praise or others, it outperforms supervised classifiers on more finer-grained classification of determining the direction of blame and praise, i.e., self-blame, blame-others, self-praise or praise-others, despite not using labelled training data.",

Considering that moral values vary significantly across cultures and yet many recurrent themes are observed and that each culture builds its societal and ideological narratives on top of its moral virtues, an enhanced understanding of morality can prove to be a valuable tool in deterring disinformation narratives by adversaries. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of latent moral loadings over time and across different sub-narratives on human and bot-generated tweets. For this purpose, we analyze the Syrian White Helmets-related tweets from April 1st, 2018 to April 30th, 2019. For the operationalization and quantification of moral rhetoric in tweets, we use Moral Foundations Dictionary in which five psychological dimensions (Harm/Care, Subversion/Authority, Cheating/Fairness, Betrayal/Loyalty and Degradation/Purity) are considered. Our results present the significant differences between the strength and patterns of moral rhetoric for human and bot-generated content on Twitter.",

      "abstract": "Rooted in the intuitionist approach to moral judgment, Moral Foundations Theory provides a reasonable coverage of moral concerns. It assumes a pluralistic first draft to the moral mind which develops under the influence of the environment and leads to cross-cultural differences in judgment of right and wrong. This study examines the mental representations of Iranians regarding morality using MFT as the framework. Participants were 172 Iranian adults. Their views on ideal society, and immoral and moral behaviors were obtained using open-ended questions which provided three different contexts to evoke morality-related conceptions. Responses were divided up into chunks and each chunk was categorized as belonging to moral foundations. A repeated measures analysis of variance was carried out with frequency of reference to foundations as the dependent variable being predicted by two within-subjects factors of question and moral foundation. Fairness, care, and sanctity were found to be the most salient moral foundations, whereas liberty and loyalty ranked last. Moreover, the interaction of question and foundation was significant. The pattern of Iranians' endorsement of foundations seems to be a blend of Western and Eastern moral profiles. The results also suggest that the pattern of reference to foundations was sensitive to semantic context. Notably, liberty, which is the recent addition to the list of moral foundations, was more easily evoked in the context of views on ideal society than within the context of questions on moral and immoral behaviors.",

This is a particularly challenging problem because moral values are often only implicitly signaled in language, and tweets contain little contextual information due to length constraints. To address these obstacles, we present a novel approach to automatically acquire background knowledge from an external knowledge base to enrich input texts and thus improve moral value prediction. By combining basic textual features with background knowledge, our overall context-aware framework achieves performance comparable to a single human annotator. Our approach obtains 13.3% absolute F -score gains compared to our baseline model that only uses textual features.",

Building upon previous research, this work focuses on the task of automatic radicalization detection in texts using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. In this way, we investigate the effectiveness of integrating moral values through the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Moral values play a crucial role in identifying ideological inclinations and can have a significant impact on the radicalization detection task. Our approach distinguishes itself in the feature extraction stage, leveraging moral values, emotions, and similarity-based features that utilize word embeddings. Additionally, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed representations with three distinct datasets that model radicalization and use the SHAP method to gain relevant insight into the models’ reasoning.",

We compared the rating distributions between the regular reviewers and the moral-concerned reviewers, and found that their rating patterns significantly differ from each other. Our findings also indicate that people with moral concerns tend to rate lower if a moral foundation is violated.

However, little is known about the roles of and relationships between those foundations in everyday moral situations. To address these, we quantify moral foundations from a large amount of online conversations (tweets) about moral topics on the social media site Twitter. We measure moral loadings using latent semantic analysis of tweets related to topics on abortion, homosexuality, immigration, religion, and immorality in general, showing how the five moral foundations function in spontaneous conversations about moral violating situations. The results indicate that although the five foundations are mutually related, Purity is the most distinctive foundation and Care is the most dominant foundation in everyday conversations on immorality.

      "abstract": "In today's modern society, many parents are busy building a successful career and it is very common that there are many young families with both parents working. Hence, the young children of such families will be placed in day-care centres or they are looked after by their grandparents and maids. Working parents would not be spending much quality time with their children and providing them with moral guidance. This group of children, if not given adequate and proper guidance, would not know much about good moral values. There are also children who grow up around people who do not practise good moral values and commit all types of wrongdoings such as cheating, stealing, bullying, being selfish, greedy, uncaring and ill-treating animals. It is easy for children to be influenced by such actions and behaviours. Therefore, this research plans to assist in imparting moral values to children by using the concept of “edutainment” with the use of a mobile application. Based on the results collected in this research, the application is fully functional without any bugs because all the respondents who took part in the testing of the application were able to launch the application on their mobile phones successfully. The results also show that the mobile application is well received by both parents and the children and it has been effective in helping children aged 4 to 9 to have a better understanding of moral values.",

If so, individual differences in moral values may relate to regional variation in brain structure. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 70 young, healthy adults examining whether differences on two major dimensions of moral values were significantly associated with regional gray matter volume. The two clusters of moral values assessed were \"individualizing\" (values of harm/care and fairness) and \"binding\" (deference to authority, in-group loyalty, and purity/sanctity). Individualizing was positively associated with left dorsomedial pFC volume and negatively associated with bilateral precuneus volume. For binding, a significant positive association was found for bilateral subcallosal gyrus and a trend to significance for the left anterior insula volume.

      "abstract": "Morality plays an important role in culture, identity, and emotion. Recent advances in natural language processing have shown that it is possible to classify moral values expressed in text at scale. Morality classification relies on human annotators to label the moral expressions in text, which provides training data to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, these annotations are inherently subjective and some of the instances are hard to classify, resulting in noisy annotations due to error or lack of agreement. The presence of noise in training data harms the classifier's ability to accurately recognize moral foundations from text. We propose two metrics to audit the noise of annotations. The first metric is entropy of instance labels, which is a proxy measure of annotator disagreement about how the instance should be labeled. The second metric is the silhouette coefficient of a label assigned by an annotator to an instance. This metric leverages the idea that instances with the same label should have similar latent representations, and deviations from collective judgments are indicative of errors. Our experiments on three widely used moral foundations datasets show that removing noisy annotations based on the proposed metrics improves classification performance.1",

      "abstract": "In the political debate on Autonomous Weapon Systems strong views and opinions are voiced, but empirical research to support these opinions is lacking. Insight into which moral values are related to the deployment of Autonomous Weapon Systems is missing. We describe the empirical results of two studies on moral values regarding Autonomous Weapon Systems that aim to understand the perception of people pertaining to the introduction of Autonomous Weapon Systems. One study consists of a sample of military personnel of the Dutch Ministry of Defense and the second study contains a sample of civilians. The results indicate both groups are more anxious about the deployment of Autonomous Weapon Systems than about the deployment of Human Operated drones, and that they perceive Autonomous Weapon Systems to have less respect for the dignity of human life. The concerns for Autonomous Weapon Systems creating new kinds of psychological and moral harm is very present in the public debate, and this is in our opinion one element that deserves to be carefully considered in future debates on the ethics of the design and deployment of Autonomous Weapon Systems. The results of these studies reveal a common ground regarding the moral values of human dignity and anxiety pertaining the introduction of Autonomous Weapon Systems which could further the ethical debate.",

      "abstract": "Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory is an influential scientific account of morality incorporating psychological, developmental, and evolutionary perspectives. The theory proposes that morality is built upon five innate \"foundations,\" each of which is believed to have been selected for during human evolution and, subsequently, tuned-up by learning during development. We argue here that although some general elements of Haidt's theory are plausible, many other important aspects of his account are seriously flawed. First, innateness and modularity figure centrally in Haidt's account, but terminological and conceptual problems foster confusion and ambiguities. Second, both the theory's proposed number of moral foundations and its taxonomy of the moral domain appear contrived, ignoring equally good candidate foundations and the possibility of substantial intergroup differences in the foundations' contents. Third, the mechanisms (viz., modules) and categorical distinctions (viz., between foundations) proposed by the theory are not consilient with discoveries in contemporary neuroscience concerning the organization, functioning, and development of the brain. In light of these difficulties, we suggest that Haidt's theory is inadequate as a scientific account of morality. Nevertheless, the theory's weaknesses are instructive, and hence, criticism may be useful to psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers attempting to advance theories of morality, as well as to researchers wishing to invoke concepts such as innateness and modularity more generally.",

To our knowledge, no studies thus far have addressed this perspective in considering the moral values within this robotic domain. However, their values could conflict with the values upheld by other relevant stakeholders, such as the values of teachers, parents or children. Hence, it is crucial to take the various perspectives of relevant stakeholder's moral values into account. For this study, multiple focus group sessions (n=3) were conducted in The Netherlands with representatives (n=13) of robotic companies on their views of robots in primary education. Their perceptions in terms of opportunities and concerns, were then linked to business values reported in the extant literature. Results show that out of 26 business values, mainly six business values appeared relevant for robot tutors: 1) profitability, 2) productivity, 3 & 4) innovation and creativity, 5) competitiveness, and 6) risk orientation organization..",

Traditionally, Chilean universities with existing ethics courses teach them using a philosophical or theological perspective, limited to occidental theories, and usually from a Christian point of view. This article studies the impact of a new methodology and technique to teach ethics in Chile: case-based, non-normative, and with a critical-descriptive approach. An empirical study is conducted to assess the relative impact of an ethics class on students individual and inherent moral values and attitudes, and understand the factors that contribute to this impact. Results indicate that even though the importance of religion in Chile is decreasing, it is still a major source of students' ethical principles and moral values.

      "abstract": "Based on the beliefs that human life and pregnancy begin at conception, that human life has equal moral value regardless of its development stage or form, and that emergency contraception (EC) has mechanisms of action that may induce abortion, Catholic health care facilities are not permitted to provide EC to rape victims if any possibility exists that a woman may have conceived due to her rape, even if that possibility is unverifiable. The Catholic Church claims that the mechanism of action of EC is uncertain and that some studies have concluded that disruption of implantation, which the Church considers to be abortion, may occur. Drawing on insights from feminist epistemology (e.g. work by Helen Longino) and arguments at the intersection of bioethics and philosophy of science (including work by Robert Veatch and Grant Gillett), we argue that the Church's position on this matter is based on uncertain (and misinterpreted) scientific claims and that particular normative (moral and theological) commitments on the part of those wielding power over Church Law lead to a weighing of probabilities in a manner consonant with the preservation of that power. In this paper, we examine how normative commitments infuse or infect the assessment of probability and influence ethical policy. We also examine how probabilism, a moral method that operates within the constraints of Catholic normative commitments, offers an alternative approach which respects, acknowledges, and maximizes an individual's ability to determine probable reason for moral action in the face of irreducible uncertainty.",

In particular, multiculturalism is part of the process of globalization, and that can be seen in U.S. universities whose students have different nationalities, ethnicities, and cultures. But we know very little about the impact engineering ethics education has on students' ethical values or attitudes and moreover, if diversity contributes to it. An empirical study is conducted to first, assess the relative impact of an ethics class in student's individual and inherent moral values, and second, to determine if demographic characteristics of the students as individuals and as a group contributes to this impact. An initial Schwartz value profile of each student was obtained at the beginning of the semester and compared to their after-class value profile.

However, in certain conditions, conflict may occur in an agent society; especially if there are selfish agents. A selfish agent places the achievement of its own goal as the main priority in its actions. To strike a balance between the achievement of an agent's own goal and its shared goal, strong moral values should be instilled in software agent environments. Sincerity is one strong human moral values that has been proven to bring many benefits to human society and reduce selfish attitude. By adapting human sincere behaviour, conflicts in software agent society could be mitigated. Sincerity behaviour can also influence a software agent to be more rational in its action and sensitive to its work environment. In our work, we study the situations in which software agents demonstrate sincere behavior in task performances. This paper proposes algorithms of sincere actions of rational agents when completing a given task.",

      "abstract": "Improving performance of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the most important focus of AI studies. As a result, AI is expected to replace what considered to be done by human intelligence. Additionally, human societies are willing to accept AI agents as members to collaborate with. For AI agents to be successfully integrated into human societies, the agents must understand important values in the societies. Ethics is a system of values that sustain the societies and it is considered as the most important. Therefore, there should be a way for AI agents to understand ethical values of human societies. In this paper, we show how to extract ethical values and moral values of the age from news articles using natural language processing. Our result shows that from newspaper articles ethical and moral values could be extracted and modeled for AI agents to refer. In conclusion AI can calculated ethicality of text by itself. In the future, we can develop more ethical autonomous AI agents.",

      "abstract": "In today's digital age, technology has a firm grasp on practically every aspect of human life, consequently there is growing cross-sector demand to help individuals build digital competencies such as digital literacy, digital skills, and digital readiness. However, there is no universally accepted meaning of terms like “digital literacy,” “digital skills,” or “digital readiness,” which can lead to difficulty coordinating efforts to improve digital competencies worldwide. Digital Intelligence (DQ) was developed to encompass a comprehensive set of technical, cognitive, meta-cognitive, and socio-emotional competencies, which are grounded in universal moral values and enable individuals to face the challenges of digital life and adapt to its demands. The DQ Framework is comprised of 8 areas of digital life--identity, use, safety, security, emotional intelligence, literacy, communication, and rights--across 3 levels of experience--citizenship, creativity, and competitiveness. The objective of this standard is to establish a DQ global standard that encompasses a common framework to ensure that digital competency building efforts are coordinated globally. It includes a common set of definitions, language, and understanding of digital literacy, skills, and readiness that can be adopted by all stakeholders worldwide, including national governments, the educational industry, the technology industry, international agencies, private companies, and society as a whole.",

Surprisingly, current approaches largely disregard such a framework and concentrate primarily on challenges pertaining to the data lifecycle. However, a smart city involves much more than data gathering: it involves the interactions of residents, businesses, and government agencies with respect to public and private resources subject to potentially subtle regulations and other norms. This article introduces a sociotechnical view of smart cities and shows how it may be profitably mapped to the moral foundation theory to provide a comprehensive ethical framework.",

      "abstract": "Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup is one of the folk stories originating from Riau Province. This folk tale has a fairly good moral value to be conveyed to the next generation, which is to be kind, caring, and maintaining the mandate given by parents. The current generation, commonly referred to as Z generation, is not accustomed to reading books, this generation uses smartphones more often to access technology, while the folklore of Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup is mostly still in book form. This research raises the folklore of Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup using Augmented Reality technology, so the Z generation is interested in seeing and listening to this folk tale. This study uses Blender for making 3D animations and Kudan SDK libraries with markerless techniques for Augmented Reality and user interface uses Unity application and runs on the Android operating system. The Augmented Reality of Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup folklore concluded that the application can display 3D animated in dim light with the intensity of 30 lux light and the distance to display an object was at least 5 cm to 90 cm with an angle of 10-90 degrees. Based on user validation, 90% of respondents strongly agree that Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup folklore is made in the form of an Augmented Reality application.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the social structure of our country has undergone tremendous changes, the moral value of people is gradually lost. As a group that has just become independent in society, the moral personality of college students is also facing severe challenges, so researchers need to re-study this issue. Research process: This paper takes the students of Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine as the research objects, and uses a self-designed questionnaire to investigate the moral personality of 117 college students, the subjects ranged from the first year of college to the third year of graduate school. This paper uses SPSS 26.0 statistical software to process and analyze data. The statistical analysis methods used included descriptive statistics, Spearman’s rank correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis. This paper firstly determines the current situation of moral personality of college students through descriptive statistical analysis method, and then discusses which factors are related to moral personality through the method of correlation analysis, and finally puts the factors determined in the previous step into the regression equation to determine this factor The degree of influence on the moral personality of college students. The significance of this research is to explore the current situation of college students’ moral personality, predict the degree of influence of ideological and political education courses and other factors on college students’ moral personality, and conduct practical research on the ways and methods of college students’ moral personality training.",

      "abstract": "In bioengineering training for new researchers and engineers, a great deal of time is spent discussing what constitutes “good” design. Conceptualization of good design, however, varies widely across interdisciplinary team members, with potential to both foster innovation or lead to unproductive conflict. To explore how groups central to bioengineering teams (physicians/clinicians and engineers/physicists) conceptualize good design, we asked 176 professionals in bioengineering to complete a comprehensive online survey including items designed to assess cognitive and moral foundations (validated MFQ30 tool) and custom items assessing perceptions on good design in three areas (good design characteristics, reputation of design approvers, and perceived design patient/consumer suitability). Of those that responded, 82 completed all quantitative survey sections and were included in this preliminary analysis. Correlations between response areas were examined to explore the possible links between cognitive and moral biases and perspectives on good design. The survey results indicated that both groups were more conservative than average Americans based on previous reports, and clinicians scored higher on average for all MFQ30 domains. Numerous significant correlations with good design were observed among clinicians, while engineers/physicists most closely correlated good design with prescriber approval and scientific/technical literature. The exploratory analysis demonstrated the potential utility of sociological frameworks to explore relationships in design thinking with potential utility to stimulate thriving conversation on team-based design thinking in bioengineering education and practice.",

      "abstract": "At first glance ethics and technology seem to have no interaction. However, we see the influence of ethics on technology both from the profession and the public. For example the “code of professional ethics” has changed the procedures in different parts of science, engineering and technology, and has given a particular direction to the types of projects done, their scope, and implementations. The sensitivity of consumers to choose moral values has also resulted in the change of direction for many technologies. Public participation in science and technology and the legal channels are the other factors that shape the influence of ethics on technology. More controversially on the other side we see the impact of technology on ethics. One can argue how and why some of the most abstract ideas like normative ethical theories or Kantian ethics have been reactions to the advancements in science and technology. Additionally, the effects of technological change have greatly influenced modern relativistic ethics. Technology has provided new possibilities for human life and created new ethical questions too. In a sense, \"applied ethics\" is the product of technological development. A different view of the ethics of science and technology is discussed and analyzed in this paper.",

The power of story telling has now been realized by computer science and software engineering community. It has been argued that story telling will enable the actual requirement to be identified earlier in the software development process. This approach has also been identified as one of the most suitable approach for end-user software development. A number of software development environment based on story telling approach have been developed, such as Storytelling Alice and JPie. Storytelling Alice is a programming environment that enables end-users (in this case students) to create computer applications by creating short 3D animated movies. JPie is a programming environment that was designed to enable end-users to develop programs by using Java programming language. In this paper, we describe the design of a story telling approach for blocks integration in Block-Based Software Development Environment. A block is basically a single-layer software component that can perform a specific function. It is assumed that in this environment, there will be a large number of blocks to be used by the end-users through story telling approach. End-users can develop applications by writing instructions for selecting, customizing and combining software blocks to form a learning application as target application.",

This project was carried out taking advantage of new and emerging information technologies. CITRA, which uses the CD-ROM and computer as the means of dissemination, is a didactic tool that comprises of four strictly interrelated learning modules: (i) storytelling world module, (ii) enjoyable reading world module, (iii) word enrichment corner, and (iv) mind test land module that consists of moral values appreciation test and application test, which focus on the presentation and evaluation of moral knowledge. The design and development of CITRA was made using the experience from other interactive multimedia applications, as well as referred to education and Malay literature specialists. The principle objective of this project is to create a didactic tool that uses different communications mediums within a single computer program, which allows the positive images of stories to be projected and can foster good moral sense in children. The paper also discusses the findings of the research, which indicates that the use of CITRA is significantly more effective as compared to the use of conventional instruction method in projecting positive values and images of narratives for assisting in moral education teaching learning.",

A Delphi study with the help of e-Learning experts was conducted to investigate and control this issue. Lack of face to face traditional interaction among students and teachers in e-Learning was observed the root cause of ethical dilemma. Moreover, deficiency of counseling and traditional policies in independent e-learning environment also become the cause of this ethical dilemma. Different approaches to control this issue were also discussed and investigated to propose a model. It is recommended to involve members of the society as virtual academic counsellor in e-Learning to develop ethical and moral values of students. The study fulfils an identified need that how ethics can be integrated in e-Learning management system of academic institution to produce ethically competent graduates. It is expected that by following provided guidelines, the passing graduates will have field specific knowledge along with good ethical building to serve not just their families and societies but the entire nation.",

      "abstract": "Social control theory argues that religious people would stick to the ethical codes of religion. The theory further asserts that religion would have tremendous effects on individuals' moral attitudes and behavior. This study tests social control theory. Data were collected from a sample of 911 people who were 18 or older at the time of study. The analysis reveals that Protestants have stronger moral values, are less corrupted, volunteer more for community service, and have better concerns for others than atheists. These differences, although significant statistically, are not so great. Religious activities such as church attendance, family worship, and participation in church activities have small effects on the Protestants' attitudes toward violence, and reasonable effects on voluntary service. Various religiosity indices have reasonable and consistent effects on the Protestants' attitudes toward marital fidelity and violence and on some of the moral behaviors in a positive way. The effects of religion on the Protestants' morality are, however, not as great as social control theory predicts.",

      "abstract": "The development in education in the 21st century has demanded Malaysian students to be on par or better with other students in advanced countries. Various pedagogics of teaching and learning are introduced in the class in order to produce good students in thinking, technical and moral values skills. One of the pedagogics introduced is using robotic education in the Malaysian education system. Among the advantages of robotic education are students can play in the learning process, can use ICT, problem solving, reasoning and working in teams. It was introduced in the education system particularly in the primary and secondary school education in 2005 by the Ministry of Education of Malaysia as a co-curricular activity which later is expanded as a competition from schools, districts, and states, national to international levels. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of robotic education in enhancing learning process among students. Quantitative approach by using questionnaires method to thirty selected students is employed. The result indicated that many students agreed that robotic education is required and relevant in enhancing learning process among students. It provides an interesting and positive learning environment where students are exposed various teaching and learning activities in the classroom where the students have to conduct experiments to get answers for each question which different from conventional learning activity of memorization and writing. As a conclusion, robotic education would entice students' to learn by themself besides that can help to improve students thinking skills.",

      "abstract": "There are several types of institutions which provide private Quran instruction in Turkey. The most prevail of institutions are Imam-Hatip High Schools and private Quran courses. Also, after the changes in educational system in 2012, optional Quran courses have been made available to all students in elementary schools. In addition, there is a mandatory course entitled Religious Culture and Moral Education in schools. However, teaching Quran is not a part of course content. Rather, it aims to teach individuals cultural, religious, and moral values. Also, within this course, students are required to learn short surahs and duas for prayer and their Turkish meanings. However, while teaching/learning these surahs and duas, teachers and students face many difficulties. Specifically, students who do not know Arabic have to memorize those surahs and duas that are written by using letters from Latin Alphabet, which causes incorrect readings phonetically. Also, this course is given two hours per week, thus, it is difficult for teachers to focus on each student and correct mis-readings. In this study, based on the problems mentioned above, an instructional material was designed to help students learn short surahs and duas for prayer. Elementary school students' development level and features of interactive whiteboards were considered while designing the software. The software consists of three levels. The first level aims to teach students surahs and duas in Arabic by listening and watching. The second level focuses on their meanings. The third level is devoted for sustainability through practices. Students who get to the third level have to answer some filling-the-gap and drag & drop questions, matching the meanings with surahs/duas, and similar activities.",

Six possible benchmarks are considered: autonomy, imitation, intrinsic moral value, moral accountability, privacy, and reciprocity.

The responsibility that students talked about was most commonly held toward a general community or society, and occasionally toward the environment or the world as a whole. In describing how the responsibility manifested itself, students talked most often about giving back or helping others, but also about a responsibility to conduct acts of service or charity. Finally, students infrequently directly cited a source of the responsibility, though some described ethical or moral foundations while others talked about an obligation due to possessing certain skills or privileges. Few differences were found in these definitions based on gender, academic rank, or major. Understanding how engineering student's view their social responsibility as both citizen and engineer is crucial towards shaping educational approaches to develop holistic engineers, able to work across disciplinary and cultural divides toward solutions of complex social issues.",

      "abstract": "This full research paper develops a framework for using comparative case studies to triangulate with quantitative survey data in engineering ethics education research.Ethics has long been recognized as crucial to responsible engineering, but the increasingly globalized environments of contemporary engineering present challenges to effective engineering ethics training. An overarching goal of our team’s larger project is to examine the effects of culture and education on ethics training in undergraduate engineering students at universities in the United States, China, and the Netherlands to assess how this training impacts students’ ethical reasoning and moral dispositions, and how this differs cross-culturally. To gauge students’ moral dispositions and ethical reasoning skills and to measure any change in these, we administer the Moral Foundations Questionnaire and the Engineering & Science Issues Test to engineering students longitudinally over four years. Because the conditions related to engineering ethics education differ widely per participating institution, interpreting and analyzing survey quantitative data will require understanding the contextual conditions of education at each institution. In this paper we ask the question what and how can case study methods contribute to longitudinal and cross-cultural ethics educational research with large data sets? To answer it, we develop conceptual and methodological foundations for the design of comparative, multi-institutional case studies to contextualize, complement, and interpret quantitative and qualitative data on ethical reasoning and moral dispositions. We develop comparative case studies to supply missing contextual information for triangulation with quantitative and qualitative data and to provide a more complete picture of the engineering ethics educational contexts, strategies, and practices at each of the participating universities. In this project, case studies provide informational and contextual significance to the other sources of data our research produces, elucidating conditions required to understand and make sense of the results of the research. In the paper we introduce our research project, motivate the use of case studies in our research by reviewing literature on case studies and multi-method triangulation in educational research. We explain how specific cases will be designed, and by providing the first step of two cases, timelines of ethics interventions for two degree programs, demonstrate the informational and interpretive need for comparative case studies in triangulating with other data sources. By using multiple case design to compare universities’ approaches in this frame, our analysis can respond to particular institutional educational contexts and cultural and language factors, make cross-cultural comparisons, and offer recommendations about responsible and culturally responsive engineering ethics education.",

The goal of the HERA project is to provide theoretically well-founded and practically usable logic-based machine ethics tools for implementation in robots. The novelty is that HERA implements multiple ethical principles like utilitarianism, the principle of double effect, and a Pareto-inspired principle. These principles can be used to automatically assess moral situations represented in a format we call causal agency models. We discuss how to model moral situations using our approach, and how it can cope with uncertainty about moral values. Finally, we briefly outline the architecture of our robot IMMANUEL, which implements HERA and is able to explain ethical decisions to humans.",

      "abstract": "Ethics education is a requirement in undergraduate engineering education, but evidence suggests that there is a limited improvement, and perhaps even diminishment, in moral commitments and capacities in engineering students during college. In the present paper, we gauge the current state of ethics education and identify opportunities for improvement given current trends in teaching ethics in engineering. We find that engineering ethics education has a number of suboptimal characteristics. First, engineering ethics does not show clear links to varying ethical theories that might inform ethical reasoning and decision making. Second, engineering ethics education places a heavy emphasis on compliance or rule-following, which provides fewer opportunities for internalizing moral values and virtues. Third, ethics lessons often emphasize case studies of rare or extreme circumstances, like the NASA space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986, reinforcing the perception that morality is an infrequent professional concern. In the interest of improving ethics education, we introduce character education as a valuable approach to undergraduate engineering ethics education, one grounded in philosophical and psychological work on developing virtuous dispositions as well as personal, professional, and societal flourishing. We describe what character education in engineering might look like and sketch how it could help the profession and its stakeholders achieve both personal and professional outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The moral values associated with scientific research were studied by means of interviews with 57 academic researchers of faculty status. The areas examined were freedom in research, impartiality, suspension of judgment until sufficient evidence is at hand, absence of bias, diffusion of information, and group loyalty. Two dimensions of creativity were measured in the respondents: rate of publication and strength of motivation toward research as judged by peers. Neither of these measures was significantly related to acceptance of the classical position in any of the six areas of value. It is concluded that the classical morality of science is not associated to any important degree with productive research.",

In this study, we explored the moral considerations related to social robots from the perspective of Dutch educational policymakers by first identifying opportunities and concerns and then mapping them onto (moral) values from the literature. To explore their moral considerations, we conducted focus group sessions with Dutch Educational Policymakers (N = 20). Considerations varied from the potential to lower the workload of teachers, to concerns related to the increased influence of commercial enterprises on the educational system. In total, the considerations of the policymakers related to 15 theoretical values. We identified the moral considerations of educational policymakers to gain a better understanding of a governmental attitude towards the use of social robots. This helps to create the necessary moral guidelines towards a responsible implementation of social robots in education.",

      "abstract": "Increasingly, humanitarian organizations across the globe have been implementing innovative technologies in their practice as they respond to the needs of communities affected by conflicts, disasters, and public health emergencies. However, technological innovation may intersect with moral values, norms, and commitments, and may challenge humanitarian imperatives. Through the examination of an empirical case study on drone mapping, this paper aims to explore three questions: (1) What are the dynamics between aid delivery and technological innovation in the humanitarian enterprise? (2) How are structural problems addressed in an environment in which technology is being portrayed as a force for change? (3) What moral responsibilities towards vulnerable populations should humanitarian stakeholders bear when introducing innovative technologies in humanitarian action. Discussion revolves around the ideology of “technological utopia”, and the normative role of technology in the aid sector - to make substantive impacts, or to produce “success stories”. In conclusion, a call for rigorous ethical analysis to help foster value sensitive humanitarian innovation (VSHI) is made.",

The greed for materialistic and worldly things is increasing. The trend can be partially contributed to the modern education system, where total emphasis is on domain and technical knowledge. Teaching of moral values is considered as an integral part of the education in Islam. The contents of our formal education syllabi are gradually throwing out material on character development. With the busy schedule of individuals, the role of character development by the family and society is diminishing. The only hope is left with the teacher. In the e-Learning platform that hope is also disappearing because of physical absence of teacher. The work will analyze the learning models and role of ethical development. It is also proposing a model using ICTs which can help in the character development of the students in the e-Learning environments.",

      "abstract": "An ethical leader is one whose actions and influence processes are consistent with ethical and moral values. Research indicates the effect of the leaders' values on the ethical choices they make. Ethical leadership percolates down to shape the ethical attitudes of people at lower levels, thereby setting the ethical climate of the organization. This paper identifies the imperative for ethical leadership and the manner in which it is manifested in universities and research organizations in India, and suggests an ethical leadership framework for academic and research administrators. The central argument of this paper is that the leader's own value system, attitudes and influence strategies shape employee behavior and set the ethical tone of the organization. This paper is based on literature review and in-depth exploratory interviews with 26 key informants including institutional leaders and members of the top management and middle-level management in four universities and two research organizations in north India. The first part of our ethical leadership framework includes the dimensions of ethical leadership, while the latter part incorporates the outcomes of ethical leadership. The dimensions of ethical leadership include value orientation, attitudes and influence strategies of the leader. The outcomes of ethical leadership are discussed at three levels of organizational behavior, namely, the individual (micro), the work group (meso) and the organization (macro). This paper recommends strategies for research and education planners, policy makers and administrators to build ethical leadership amongst researchers and academics.",

      "abstract": "Storytelling is a way to represent events using words, images and sounds, often by improvisation. Stories or narratives have been shared in all cultures as a way to entertain, educate, for cultural preservation and as a way to transmit moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling are the plot, the characters and the narrative point of view. Currently there are several languages and tools that allow the creation of virtual worlds, and however, few tools for creating 3D storytelling. Existing approaches are not intuitive and require a deeper knowledge of the user to enable the creation of virtual worlds with higher quality graphics, enabling the integration of customized multimedia presentations. This paper presents a solution for interactive storytelling, targeted to children and juvenile public, called Mogre-Storytelling. This tool claims to be intuitive, providing different functionalities for the creation and customization of scenarios in 3D, allowing the addition of 3D models from the Internet and even enabling the creation of virtual story using multimedia and storytelling elements such as speech bubbles, sounds and images. Mogre- Storytelling is a new option for users who want to create stories with scenarios in 3D and is an alternative to Ogre application developers, since this tool enables the rapid creation of customized scenarios with higher quality 3D graphics, while still allowing the integration of multimedia presentations using an XML file structure.",

      "abstract": "During ancient Indian times, the Gurukul system of education was the style of learning in the country. In this system the students were learning with their mentors (Gurus) and receiving education, knowledge, moral values and life skills under the guidance of their gurus. This system of education was practiced in ancient times, where all students who resided at the place of the guru in the Gurukula were considered equal. As the days passed the things took a drastic change and government schools were introduced. A few decades ago, the number of students in government schools decreased due to the privatization of the education system. Later, more schools were introduced by corporations, which led to a significant increase in the number of schools. To perform the tasks like monitoring and taking the attendance of each class was tedious job at the same time it was time consuming, where the total number of students in each class has increased and number of subjects for each class also increased and every teacher has to document the number of students attending the classes for each subject and they need to submit it to the higher authorities. To overcome these difficulties, In this paper a novel approach is schemed to record attendance of all the students of a class. In the proposed system to take the attendance of the students all at once, a live video is processed for each frame and to recognize the faces of all the students it uses a deep convolutional neural network face recognition algorithm which extract 128-dimensional face encodings from images and then compares these encodings with the faces stored in the dataset to determine the best match and further the attendance of the students present in the class is recorded in the form of excel sheet so that the teacher can carry out the further analysis. The findings of the experiment overcomes the difficulties faced in the existing systems and eyewitnesses the furturistic transition in marking attendance.",

This procedure is based on a game simulation played out by dyads composed either of one adult and one adolescent or of two adolescents. A pilot study using this procedure has been conducted in an educational setting, since listening detection may be seen as a basic competence for successful scaffolding interactions, by which adults not only enhance but also orient adolescents' development. Among the different data resulting from our pilot study, in this paper we focus our attention on multimodal annotation schemata relating to adolescents' nodding when listening to their teachers expressing their personal judgments on some moral dilemmas – assuming that the capacity to take a stance on moral values is one of the main developmental tasks adolescents have to cope with. Although widely recognized--starting from the classic work of Darwin on the expressions of emotions in man and animals--as a social signal of acceptance of the other's message, in our pilot study nodding proved at times to be a signal that the adolescents weren't comprehending the words of their teachers at all. Selected examples of multimodal observations are presented of features characterizing adult-adolescent interactions when this specific kind of nodding without understanding occurs. In the final part of the paper, limitations of this procedure are discussed. Finally, a perspective for future works is presented.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of adult content on social media has harmful effects on the moral values of young individuals. Therefore, effectively filtering inappropriate content on social media like Twitter is essential. Researchers have utilized machine learning and natural language processing techniques to develop automated systems that can identify adult content. However, using Transformer to detect adult content in the Indonesian language has yet to be thoroughly explored. Identifying adult content in a text is relatively challenging due to its subjective and context-dependent nature. The same words can be used in explicit or non-explicit contexts depending on the context or intended meaning of the surrounding text. This study aims to explore the implementation of fine-tuned Transformer-based models for identifying adult and sexually explicit content in Indonesian Twitter texts. We fine-tuned five pre-trained Transformer-based models: IndoBERT, IndoBERTweet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and DistilmBERT. Based on our experiments, we can see that all the models showed effectiveness in accurately classifying adult and non-adult content. Among the Transformer-based models, XLM-RoBERTa and IndoBERTweet demonstrated effective adult content identification in Indonesian tweets compared to other pre-trained models. XLM-RoBERTa showed a slightly better performance, which can be attributed to its larger size and advanced training techniques.",

      "abstract": "To the City Beautiful movement, the commercialization of light expressed an individualistic social fragmentation that adherents worked to overcome by holding expositions, building public libraries, opening parks, establishing museums, and creating other uplifting institutions that would put all social classes on an equal footing. In such public spaces, lighting could make knowledge, culture, and entertainment accessible to all. City Beautiful proponents were disturbed by the commercialization of urban public space. As Peter Baldwin notes, the new white ways were “buzzing with energy and barely suppressed eroticism.” Reformers such as Jane Addams feared that such districts might overwhelm the still-undeveloped sensibilities of adolescents. The new “urban night was not an extension of day; it was a liminal new world in which conflicting moral values mingled uneasily [and] … heightened the excitement of the nighttime street.”1 Most people still did not have electricity at home, and the brilliant, pulsating lights of downtown were an alluring contrast to domestic space, even if reformers thought it garish. Houses and apartments began to seem dim, especially if invaded by light from the street. Reformers also objected to the skyscraper because it blocked sunlight, created powerful winds, and disrupted the human scale of the city. Such views prevailed in Boston, where few tall buildings were erected before 1920. Reformers disliked large (especially flashing) advertising signs. They believed that “the individual has no more right to offend the public's eye with flaunting self-assertiveness than to offend its ear with crashing sounds or the nostrils with unpleasant odors.”2 They were pleased that there existed a “British Society for Checking the Abuses of Public Advertising,” and that there were strict controls on posters in Paris and many other European cities.3 They applauded when Berlin issued “stringent regulations as to the number, size and height” of electric signs, and further restricted “flash signs” on the grounds that they were injurious to the eyes and a dangerous distraction to traffic.4 And they objected to the fragmentation and incoherence of US public space, and hoped through planning to recover a sense of cohesion, order, and civility.",

      "abstract": "In today’s digital age, technology has a firm grasp on practically every aspect of human life, consequently there is growing cross-sector demand to help individuals build digital competencies such as digital literacy, digital skills, and digital readiness. However, there is no universally accepted meaning of terms like “digital literacy,” “digital skills,” or “digital readiness,” which can lead to difficulty coordinating efforts to improve digital competencies worldwide. Digital Intelligence (DQ) was developed to encompass a comprehensive set of technical, cognitive, meta-cognitive, and socio-emotional competencies, which are grounded in universal moral values and enable individuals to face the challenges of digital life and adapt to its demands. The DQ Framework is comprised of 8 areas of digital life--identity, use, safety, security, emotional intelligence, literacy, communication, and rights--across 3 levels of experience--citizenship, creativity, and competitiveness. The objective of this standard is to establish a DQ global standard that encompasses a common framework to ensure that digital competency building efforts are coordinated globally. It includes a common set of definitions, language, and understanding of digital literacy, skills, and readiness that can be adopted by all stakeholders worldwide, including national governments, the educational industry, the technology industry, international agencies, private companies, and society as a whole.",

      "abstract": "Research shows exoskeletons can reduce muscle activity and decrease the risk of injury for workers. Exoskeletons, therefore, are becoming more prevalent in industrial workplaces, and their use in some circumstances has already been mandated. It is probable that additional employers will mandate the use of exoskeletons as a means of mitigating injuries to their employees. This presents ethical concerns because employers hold power over the employees wages and employment. Some employees who are required to wear exoskeletons may not be able to, while others may not wish to. How should workers privacy and preferences be weighted? Should employees be prohibited from jobs that use exoskeletons if the exoskeletons do not fit them or if they do not wish to disclose their bodys measurements? Should companies using exoskeletons be permitted to require workers to perform additional work with an exoskeleton? In this paper, we examine these and other ethical considerations related to mandatory exoskeleton use through the Six Pillars of Character framework of the Josephson Institute of Ethics (2002) and the Universal Moral Values for Corporate Codes of Ethics framework by Schwartz (2005). We provide a discussion of possible solutions following ethical tenets, including executing pilot studies before mandatory use policies, offering several self-adjustable models of exoskeletons, and allowing existing workers to transfer jobs if they are ill at ease with new exoskeleton policies. The best course of action may depend on specific individual circumstances.",

      "abstract": "Research has shown that accounting for moral sentiment in natural language can yield insight into a variety of on- and off-line phenomena such as message diffusion, protest dynamics, and social distancing. However, measuring moral sentiment in natural language is challenging, and the difficulty of this task is exacerbated by the limited availability of annotated data. To address this issue, we introduce the Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus, a collection of 35,108 tweets that have been curated from seven distinct domains of discourse and hand annotated by at least three trained annotators for 10 categories of moral sentiment. To facilitate investigations of annotator response dynamics, we also provide psychological and demographic metadata for each annotator. Finally, we report moral sentiment classification baselines for this corpus using a range of popular methodologies.",

      "abstract": "Moral expressions in online communications can have a serious impact on framing discussions and subsequent online behaviours. Despite research on extracting moral sentiment from English text, other low-resource languages, such as Persian, lack enough resources and research about this important topic. We address this issue using the Moral Foundation theory (MFT) as the theoretical moral psychology paradigm. We developed a Twitter data set of 8000 tweets that are manually annotated for moral foundations and also we established a baseline for computing moral sentiment from Persian text. We evaluate a plethora of state-of-the-art machine learning models, both rule-based and neural, including distributed dictionary representation (DDR), long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT). Our findings show that among different models, fine-tuning a pre-trained Persian BERT language model with a linear network as the classifier yields the best results. Furthermore, we analysed this model to find out which layer of the model contributes most to this superior accuracy. We also proposed an alternative transformer-based model that yields competitive results to the BERT model despite its lower size and faster inference time. The proposed model can be used as a tool for analysing moral sentiment and framing in Persian texts for downstream social and psychological studies. We also hope our work provides some resources for further enhancing the methods for computing moral sentiment in Persian text.",

We gave two groups of participants, undergraduate medical students, the same hypothetical scenarios of research misconduct cases containing words related to different aspects of morality, and asked them to assess how inappropriate the described behavior was. Students ranked the described behaviors differently by the inappropriateness of the behavior, but the group wording was not a significant predictor of appropriateness. The reasons for the ranking were not related to any standardized procedures for research integrity but were related to the moral assessment of the students, which was assessed using qualitative approach. The results of this study implicate that personal moral views are an important part in research integrity training.",

We show that opponents to same-sex marriage are represented and represent themselves as victims whose moral values, traditions and civil liberties are being threatened by the state.

We took the approach of method- theory co-development and followed a human-led and machine-assisted procedure that emphasized opportunities for theoretical advancement, which enhances the validity of the computational tool. Starting from the existing Chinese translation of the established English moral foundation dictionaries, we enriched the dictionary with a list of unique Chinese moral-relevant words. Five experts went through four rounds of coding, followed by the validation of 202 crowd coders. The C-MFD 2.0 identifies not only the classic five moral foundations but also proposes several potential moral foundation candidates in the Chinese context. It demonstrates acceptable validity in detecting moral foundation values from Chinese texts. Our paper illustrates how a non-English moral foundation dictionary can be built for computational analysis and furthers moral foundation theory in a cross-language context.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

      "abstract": "Within the last years, whistleblowing has received considerable attention, as calls for ethical behavior in the workplace have grown louder. Despite this fact, research has shown that individuals who blow the whistle are often frowned upon and treated poorly. Previous research already tried to explain unethical behavior on social media by linking moral receptors with moral disengagement in the context of unethical behavior. For an explanation on the origins and variations in human reasoning typically Moral Foundations Theory and its ’gold-standard’ measurement scale—the Moral Foundation Questionnaire—are used. The scale has been used extensively in a range of empirical projects. However, recent research also raises criticisms from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. In this paper, a comprehensive set of Moral Foundations vignettes is developed to address some of the issues raised with the current questionnaire. Each vignette depicts a behavior violating a particular moral foundation. The validity of the developed vignettes is demonstrated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The resulting set of Moral Foundation Vignettes consists of 41 scenarios categorized in eight different factors, where Care foundation is subdivided into three different factors.",

The Moral Foundation Theory (MFT) was developed to operationalise morality in a five-dimensional scale system. Recent developments of the theory urged for the introduction of a new foundation, the Liberty Foundation. Being only recently added to the theory, there are no available linguistic resources to assess whether liberty is present in text corpora. Given its importance to current social issues such as the vaccination debate, we propose two data-driven approaches, deriving two candidate lexicons generated based on aligned documents from online news sources with different worldviews. After extensive experimentation, we contribute to the research community a novel lexicon that assesses the liberty moral foundation in the way individuals with contrasting viewpoints express themselves through written text. The LibertyMFD dictionary can be a valuable tool for policymakers to understand diverse viewpoints on controversial social issues such as vaccination, abortion, or even uprisings, as they happen and on a large scale.",

Due to its dyadic structure of values and their violations, it can be used as a theoretical background for discerning moral values from natural language text as it captures a user’s perspective on a specific topic. In this paper, we focus on the automatic detection of moral content in sentences or short paragraphs by means of machine learning techniques. We leverage on a corpus of tweets previously labeled as containing values or violations, according to the Moral Foundations Theory. We double evaluate the result of our work: (i) we compare the results of our model with the state of the art and (ii) we assess the proposed model in detecting the moral values with their polarity. The final outcome shows both an overall improvement in detecting moral content compared to the state of the art and adequate performances in detecting moral values with their sentiment polarity.",

      "abstract": "Moral rhetoric is defined as the language used for advocating or taking a moral stance towards an issue by invoking or making salient various moral concerns. The Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) can be used to evaluate expressions of moral sentiment. MFT proposes that there are five innate, universal moral foundations that exist across cultures and societies: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. We investigate the case in which texts containing MFD keywords are not expressed explicitly — hidden context. While members of high-context groups can read “between the lines” meanings, word counting methods or other NLP methods for moral sentiment detection and quantification cannot happen if the related keywords are not there to be counted. To explore the hidden context, we leverage a pretrained generative language model such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-2) that uses deep learning to produce human-like text—to generate a new story. A human writer would usually provide several prompting sentences, and the GPT model would produce the rest of the story. To customize the GPT-2 model towards a specific domain―for this paper we studied local population’s attitudes towards US military bases located in foreign countries―a training dataset from the domain can be used to finetune the GPT-2 model. Finetuning means taking weights of a trained neural network and using it as initialization for a new model being trained on the finetuning dataset. Restricted language codes (meanings are not expressed explicitly) can be used as prompting sentences, and finetuned GPT models can be used to generate multiple versions of synthetic contextual stories. Since the GPT-2 model was trained using millions of examples from a huge text corpus, the generated context contents reflect the cultural-related knowledge and common sense in the culture. In addition, since finetuned models were trained using fine-tuned dataset, the generated context contents reflect the local people’s reaction for that specific domain—which is attitudes towards US military bases in regards to this paper. After using or fine-tuning the GPT-2 model to generate multiple versions of synthetic text, some versions might contain keywords defined in the MFD. Our hypothesis is that the percentage keywords related to the five morality domains can serve as statistical indicators for the five domains. Our experiment shows that the top five morality domain types experiencing significant percentage changes between positive and negative stories, generated by fine-tuned training models, are HarmVice, AuthorityVirtue, InGroupLoyalty, FairnessVirtue and FairnessVice. The results are in line with several major issues identified between US oversea military bases and local populations by well-known existing studies. The main contribution of this research is to use AI-generated synthetic context for detecting moral sentiment and quantification.",

Following previous research, which found associations between morality, collective action, and social decision-making, we postulate that moral values are distinct across different movements since these movements represent moral values of those who support or oppose them. The result of our analysis of four movements as represented on Twitter (#BlackLivesMatter, #WhiteLivesMatter, #AllLivesMatter, and #BlueLivesMatter) reveal that #BlueLivesMatter represents values such as Care, Harm, Loyalty, and Authority, while #WhiteLivesMatter features Harm and Fairness. Moreover, we find that Harm is the most prominent moral value in all of our datasets. Our analysis provides a robust understanding of authors' moral stances, which contextualizes the influence of movements on people, and how these movements are perceived in society.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the correlation between moral foundations and the expression of opinions in the form of stance on different issues of public interest. This work is based on the assumption that the formation of values (personal and societal) and language are interrelated, and that we can observe differences in points of view in user-generated text data. We leverage the Moral Foundations Theory to expand the scope of stance analysis by examining the narratives in favor or against several topics. Applying an expanded version of the Moral Foundations Dictionary to a benchmark dataset for stance analysis, we capture and analyze the relationships between moral values and polarized online discussions. Using this enhanced methodology, we find that each social issue has different \"moral and lexical profiles.\" While some social issues project more authority related words (Donald Trump), others consists of words related to care and purity (abortion and feminism). Our correlation analysis of stance and morality revealed notable associations between stances on social issues and various types of morality, such as care, fairness, and loyalty, hence demonstrating that there are certain morality types that are more attributed to stance classification than others. Overall, our analysis highlights the usefulness of considering morality when studying stance. The differences observed in various viewpoints and stances highlights linguistic variation in discourse, which may assist in analyzing cultural values and biases in society.",

      "abstract": "Values, as intended in ethics, determine the shape and validity of moral and social norms, grounding our everyday individual and community behavior on commonsense knowledge. The attempt to untangle human moral and social value-oriented structure of relations requires investigating both the dimension of subjective human perception of the world, and socio-cultural dynamics and multi-agent social interactions. Formalising latent moral content in human interaction is an appealing perspective that would enable a deeper understanding of both social dynamics and individual cognitive and behavioral dimension. To formalize this broad knowledge area, in the context of ValueNet, a modular ontology representing and operationalising moral and social values, we present two modules aiming at representing two main informal theories in literature: (i) the Basic Human Values theory by Shalom Schwartz and (ii) the Moral Foundations Theory by Graham and Haidt. ValueNet is based on reusable Ontology Design Patterns, is aligned to the DOLCE foundational ontology, and is a component of the Framester factual-linguistic knowledge graph.",

      "abstract": "Classifying moral values in user-generated text from social media is critical in understanding community cultures and interpreting user behaviors of social movements. Moral values and language usage can change across the social movements; however, text classifiers are usually trained in source domains of existing social movements and tested in target domains of new social issues without considering the variations. In this study, we examine domain shifts of moral values and language usage, quantify the effects of domain shifts on the morality classification task, and propose a neural adaptation framework via instance weighting to improve cross-domain classification tasks. The quantification analysis suggests a strong correlation between morality shifts, language usage, and classification performance. We evaluate the neural adaptation framework on a public Twitter data across 7 social movements and gain classification improvements up to 12.1%. Finally, we release a new data of the COVID-19 vaccine labeled with moral values and evaluate our approach on the new target domain. For the case study of the COVID-19 vaccine, our adaptation framework achieves up to 5.26% improvements over neural baselines. This is the first study to quantify impacts of moral shifts, propose adaptive framework to model the shifts, and conduct a case study to model COVID-19 vaccine-related behaviors from moral values.",

      "abstract": "Most often, both agents and human societies use norms to coordinate their on-going activities. Nevertheless, choosing the 'right' set of norms to regulate these societies constitutes an open problem. Firstly, intrinsic norm relationships may lead to inconsistencies in the chosen set of norms. Secondly, and more importantly, there is an increasing demand of including ethical considerations in the decision making process. This paper focuses on choosing the 'right' norms by considering moral values together with society's partial preferences over these values and the extent to which candidate norms promote them. The resulting decision making problem can then be encoded as a linear program, and hence solved by state-of-the art solvers. Furthermore, we empirically test several optimisation scenarios so to determine the system's performance and the characteristics of the problem that affect its hardness.",

      "abstract": "We build on deontic justice and moral foundations theories to shed light on responses to sexual misconduct at work by proposing a model that explains why some third parties punish accusing victims and support alleged perpetrators. We theorize that when third parties are given conflicting he-said, she-said information, they intuitively evaluate organizational injustice based on moral values. We further theorize that binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority, purity) give rise to sympathy toward men accused of sexual misconduct and anger toward female accusers. Across five studies (total n = 5,413) utilizing archival, field, and vignette designs, we examined third-party responses to sexual misconduct accusations ranging in severity across several industries. Third-party endorsement of binding moral foundations was linked to increased perpetrator-directed sympathy and victim-directed anger (Studies 1–4). These emotions jointly mediated the relationship between binding values and credibility perceptions of the accusing victim and the alleged perpetrator (Studies 2 and 3). Moreover, victim credibility was negatively associated with social sanctions and punishment severity levied toward the accusing victim, and perpetrator credibility was negatively associated with the same punishment outcomes for the alleged perpetrator (Studies 3 and 4). In Study 5, we found that managers framing the accusing victim as disloyal exacerbated negative judgments and emotions toward the victim and positive judgments and emotions toward the perpetrator for individuals who highly ascribe to binding moral foundations. We discuss the theoretical contributions and practical implications of moral concerns on third parties’ emotions, judgments, and motivations to punish actors involved in sexual misconduct allegations.Supplemental Material: The e-companion is available at .",

Here, we expand the Moral Foundations Dictionary to European Portuguese, which we then use to analyze 10 years of transcripts of parliamentary sessions using standard Data Science and Text Mining techniques. Despite a larger number of represented parties, we show that no traditional parties fall into the Conservative or Liberal characterization and that the political landscape in Portugal is relatively homogeneous with the major difference observed concerning the dichotomy between Government and the parliament.",

Traditionally, in\nidentifying where support can be found in the\nUS Constitution for a right to informational\nprivacy, the point of focus has been on the\nFourth Amendment; protection in this context\nfinds its moral basis in personal liberty,\npersonal dignity, self-esteem, and other\nvalues. On the other hand, the constitutional\nright to privacy first established by Griswold\nv. Connecticut finds its moral basis largely\nin a single value, the value of autonomy of\ndecision-making. I propose that an expanded\nconstitutional right to informational privacy,\nresponsive to the escalating threats posed to\nonline privacy by developments in informational\ntechnology, would be more likely to find a\nsolid moral basis in the value of autonomy\nassociated with the constitutional right to\nprivacy found in Griswold than in the variety\nof values forming the moral basis for the right\nto privacy backed by the Fourth Amendment.",

This is the main reason behind many approaches focusing on local post-hoc explanations recently proposed by the XAI community. However, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough comparison among available explainability techniques is currently missing, mainly for the lack of a general metric to measure their benefits. We compare state-of-the-art local post-hoc explanation mechanisms for models trained over moral value classification tasks based on a measure of correlation. By relying on a novel framework for comparing global impact scores, our experiments show how most local post-hoc explainers are loosely correlated, and highlight huge discrepancies in their results—their “quarrel” about explanations. Finally, we compare the impact scores distribution obtained from each local post-hoc explainer with human-made dictionaries, and point out that there is no correlation between explanation outputs and the concepts humans consider as salient.",

      "abstract": "Even with the increasing frequency of robot experiences in our daily lives, relatively little research has been done to explore the moral implications of these human-robot interactions (HRI). Of the existing moral HRI research, much of it assumes a moral dimension without clearly defining what moral framework is being applied. To research such a framework, it is crucial to evaluate current research for a communicable moral framework, that is also in dialogue with key moral frameworks in social science spaces. This work uses a narrative literature review to analyze moral HRI research through the lens of the Moral Foundations Theory. The analysis will situate moral HRI work in the seminal moral theory within social science spaces and show where current gaps in HRI research might exist. Evaluating research through the lens of the moral foundations theory framework will strengthen the existence of a ‘Moral HRI’ field that is related but distinct from general HRI.",

      "abstract": "AI research is being challenged with ensuring that autonomous agents learn to behave ethically, namely in alignment with moral values. Here, we propose a novel way of tackling the value alignment problem as a two-step process. The first step consists on formalising moral values and value aligned behaviour based on philosophical foundations. Our formalisation is compatible with the framework of (Multi-Objective) Reinforcement Learning, to ease the handling of an agent’s individual and ethical objectives. The second step consists in designing an environment wherein an agent learns to behave ethically while pursuing its individual objective. We leverage on our theoretical results to introduce an algorithm that automates our two-step approach. In the cases where value-aligned behaviour is possible, our algorithm produces a learning environment for the agent wherein it will learn a value-aligned behaviour.",

However, there must be a compromise between simplification and expressiveness, determined by the results produced by the model. Here we propose to gradually increase the complexity of a model, so we can improve its behaviour. This incremental \"deepening\" process is an attempt to approach the real phenomena, so resulting in a better model, provided that an accurate analysis reveals the right steps. As application we propose an agent-based data-driven model of the evolution of moral values in the Spanish post-modern society. We focus on improving the demographic mechanisms so that the system output follows the evolution of Spanish population. In order to do that, we raise the amount of quantitative input information of the system, improve its statistical distributions, and change the time of evolution, together with other commented changes.",

To determine the best moral strategies for facilitating cross-party communication, we create an agent-based simulation underpinned by Moral Foundations Theory to model small-group moral conversations where the majority of agents align with either liberal or conservative views. We find, contrary to what moral re-framing research has assumed, that loyalty may be the best moral foundation for facilitating cross-party communication.

      "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy is a complex issue with psychological, cultural, and even societal factors entangled in the decision-making process. The narrative around this process is captured in our everyday interactions; social media data offer a direct and spontaneous view of peoples’ argumentation. Here, we analysed more than 500,000 public posts and comments from Facebook Pages dedicated to the topic of vaccination to study the role of moral values and, in particular, the understudied role of the Liberty moral foundation from the actual user-generated text. We operationalise morality by employing the Moral Foundations Theory, while our proposed framework is based on recurrent neural network classifiers with a short memory and entity linking information. Our findings show that the principal moral narratives around the vaccination debate focus on the values of Liberty, Care, and Authority. Vaccine advocates urge compliance with the authorities as prosocial behaviour to protect society. On the other hand, vaccine sceptics mainly build their narrative around the value of Liberty, advocating for the right to choose freely whether to adhere or not to the vaccination. We contribute to the automatic understanding of vaccine hesitancy drivers emerging from user-generated text, providing concrete insights into the moral framing around vaccination decision-making. Especially in emergencies such as the Covid-19 pandemic, contrary to traditional surveys, these insights can be provided contemporary to the event, helping policymakers craft communication campaigns that adequately address the concerns of the hesitant population.",

In our proposal, when the description of the current situation reveals that a moral value is 'at stake', the moral goal of re-establishing the threatened value is included among the active goals. The compliance with values generates positive emotions like pride and admiration, while the opposite brings to shame and self-reproach.During the deliberation phase, the agent appraises her plans in terms of the emotional reward they are expected to yield, given the trade off between moral and individual goals. In this phase, the emotional reward affects the agent's choices about her behavior. After the execution phase, one's and others' actions are appraised again in terms of the agent's values, giving rise to moral emotions.The paper shows how emotional appraisal can be coupled with the choice among possible lines of action, presenting a mapping between plans and emotions that integrates and extends preceding proposals.",

Negative consequences may result from hostile and “othering” portrayals of people with mental disorders. Adopting the lens of Moral Foundation Theory (MFT), we study framings of mental health discourse on Twitter and News, and how moral underpinnings abate or exacerbate stigma. We adopted a large language model based representation framework to score 13,277,115 public tweets and 21,167 news articles against MFT’s five foundations. We found discussions on Twitter to demonstrate compassion, justice and equity-centered moral values for those suffering from mental illness, in contrast to those on News. That said, stigmatized discussions appeared on both Twitter and News, with news articles being more stigmatizing than tweets. We discuss implications for public health authorities to refine measures for safe reporting of mental health, and for social media platforms to design affordances that enable empathetic discourse.",

Despite this fact, research has shown that individuals who blow the whistle are often frowned upon and treated poorly. In this context, while social media allows for offering support to the whistleblower, people may also hide behind online anonymity and engage in unethical behavior towards the whistleblower. Previous research already tried to explain unethical behavior on social media by linking moral receptors with moral disengagement in the context of unethical behavior. We built upon this approach in developing a set of propositions linking the moral receptors “harm/care”, “fairness/reciprocity”, “in-group/loyalty”, “authority/respect”, and “purity/sanctity” with moral disengagement in order to explain unethical behavior against whistleblowers on social media.

      "abstract": "In interactive story games, players make decisions that advance and modify the unfolding story. In many cases, these decisions have a moral component. Examining decision-making in these games illuminates whether players mobilize their real-life morality to make in-game decisions and what impact this has in both the game world and real life. Using mixed-methods consisting of semi-structured interviews and the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ30), we collected data from 19 participants who played the game Detroit: Become Human. We analyzed how participants applied their real-life morals toward in-game decisions using thematic analysis and statistical analysis of the MFQ30 results. Qualitative findings indicate that participants mobilize their moral intuitions to make in-game decisions and how much participants cared about their game characters influenced their choices. We contribute a better understanding of how players react to moral dilemmas in interactive story games for game designers to help them improve player experience.",

      "abstract": "Youth unemployment rates are still in alerting levels for many countries, among which Italy. Direct consequences include poverty, social exclusion, and criminal behaviours, while negative impact on the future employability and wage cannot be obscured. In this study, we employ survey data together with social media data, and in particular likes on Facebook Pages, to analyse personality, moral values, but also cultural elements of the young unemployed population in Italy. Our findings show that there are small but significant differences in personality and moral values, with the unemployed males to be less agreeable while females more open to new experiences. At the same time, unemployed have a more collectivist point of view, valuing more in-group loyalty, authority, and purity foundations. Interestingly, topic modelling analysis did not reveal major differences in interests and cultural elements of the unemployed. Utilisation patterns emerged though; the employed seem to use Facebook to connect with local activities, while the unemployed use it mostly as for entertainment purposes and as a source of news, making them susceptible to mis/disinformation. We believe these findings can help policymakers get a deeper understanding of this population and initiatives that improve both the hard and the soft skills of this fragile population.",

      "abstract": "News outlets are a primary source for many people to learn what is going on in the world. However, outlets with different political slants, when talking about the same news story, usually emphasize various aspects and choose their language framing differently. This framing implicitly shows their biases and also affects the reader’s opinion and understanding. Therefore, understanding the framing in the news stories is fundamental for realizing what kind of view the writer is conveying with each news story. In this paper, we describe methods for characterizing moral frames in the news. We capture the frames based on the Moral Foundation Theory. This theory is a psychological concept which explains how every kind of morality and opinion can be summarized and presented with five main dimensions. We propose an unsupervised method that extracts the framing Bias and the framing Intensity without any external framing annotations provided. We validate the performance on an annotated twitter dataset and then use it to quantify the framing bias and partisanship of news.",

      "abstract": "As argued by [9], moral decision making entails considering alternatives and assessing the pros and cons of their possible consequences for self and others. From the area of affective neuroscience the concept of moral emotions has been introduced [9] and neurobiological findings [7] show that moral emotions are used to judge the adequacy of actions and are central to moral behavior, decision making and learning. My aim is to build a computational model for moral emotions in order to enable intelligent agents [2] to understand moral consequences of actions through moral emotions. The agent is able to compare alternative scenarios and to decide what course of actions and goals to pursue in order to show a morally driven behavior. Moral emotions are useful when the agent is engaged in a social interaction with a user or other agents, because (i) moral emotions may lead the agent towards the compliance with (shared) moral values (ii) the agent is equipped with moral emotions which make her potentially emphatic to others.",

      "abstract": "Quantifying the moral narratives expressed in the user-generated text, news, or public discourses is fundamental for understanding individuals’ concerns and viewpoints and preventing violent protests and social polarisation. The Moral Foundation Theory (MFT) was developed precisely to operationalise morality in a five-dimensional scale system. Recent developments of the theory urged for the introduction of a new foundation, liberty. Being only recently added to the theory, there are no available linguistic resources to assess liberty from text corpora. Given its importance to current social issues such as the vaccination debate, we propose a data-driven approach to derive a liberty lexicon based on aligned documents from online encyclopedias with different worldviews. Despite the preliminary nature of our study, we show proof of the concept that large encyclopedia corpora can point out differences in the way people with contrasting viewpoints express themselves. Such differences can be used to derive a novel lexicon, identifying linguistic markers of the liberty foundation.",

      "abstract": "Virtual reality enables the creation of personalized user experience that brings together people of different cultures and ethnicity. We consider a novel concept of virtual reality innovation in museums, which is cognitively grounded and supported by data and their semantics, to enable users sharing their experiences, as well as to take the perspective of other users, with the ultimate goal of increasing social cohesion. The implementation of this scenario requires an autonomous artificial system that detects emotions and values from a dialogue involving museum visitors who express their personal point of view, listen to those from other visitors, and possibly take the perspective of others.An important feature of this system is the ability of detecting similarity and dissimilarity between user perspectives expressed in speech, when exposed to artworks. This ability helps defining an effective strategy for sharing diverse user perspectives for increasing social cohesion. Moreover, it enables an unbiased quantification of the success of the interaction in terms of change in the user perspective. Based on results from previous work, we employ the Ekman’s emotion model and Haidt’s moral value model to extract emotional and moral value profiles from user descriptions of artworks. We propose a novel method for measuring the similarity between user perspectives by comparing emotional and moral value profiles. Our results show that the employment of unsupervised text classification models is a promising research direction for this task.",

Here, administering a series of surveys via a Facebook-hosted application, we study the worldviews of people that “Liked” supportive or vaccine resilient Facebook Pages. In particular, we assess differences in political viewpoints, moral values, personality traits, and general interests, finding that those sceptical about vaccination, appear to trust less the government, are less agreeable, while they are emphasising more on anti-authoritarian values. Exploring the differences in moral narratives as expressed in the linguistic descriptions of the Facebook Pages, we see that pages that defend vaccines prioritise the value of the family while the vaccine hesitancy pages are focusing on the value of freedom. Finally, creating embeddings based on the health-related likes on Facebook Pages, we explore common, latent interests of vaccine-hesitant people, showing a strong preference for natural cures. This exploratory analysis aims at exploring the potentials of a social media platform to act as a sensing tool, providing researchers and policymakers with insights drawn from the digital traces, that can help design communication campaigns that build confidence, based on the values that also appeal to the socio-moral criteria of people.",

The tool, called DEGARI 2.0 for values, relies on the commonsense reasoning framework , and exploits an ontological model formalizing the Haidt’s theory of moral values to associate museum items with combined values and emotions. Within a museum exhibition, this tool can suggest cultural items that are associated not only with the values of already experienced or preferred objects, but also with novel items with different value stances, opening the visit experience to more inclusive interpretations of cultural content.

To further characterise the music preferences of the participants the generalist/specialist (GS) score employed. We exploit both classification and regression approaches to assess the predictive power of music preferences for the prediction of demographic attributes as well as the moral values of the participants. Our findings point out that moral values are hard to predict (.62 AUROCavg) solely by the music listening behaviours, while if basic sociodemographic information is provided the prediction score rises to 4% on average (.66 AUROCavg), with the Purity foundation to be the one that is steadily the one with the highest accuracy scores. Similar results are obtained from the regression analysis. Finally, we provide with insights on the most predictive music behaviours associated with each moral value that can inform a wide range of applications from rehabilitation practices to communication campaign design.",

We design and implement a series of new features that encourage users to challenge their understanding of opposing views, including annotation of moral frames in news articles, discussion of those frames via inline comments, and recommendations based on relevant moral frames. We describe two versions of features---the first covering a suite of ways to interact with moral framing in news, and the second tailored towards collaborative annotation and discussion. We conduct a field evaluation of each design iteration with 71 participants in total over a period of 6-8 days, finding evidence suggesting users learned to re-frame their discourse in moral values of the opposing side. Our work provides several design considerations for building systems to engage with moral framing.",

      "abstract": "This thesis makes use of insights from Dworkin's theory of law to analyse the European Court of Human Rights' case-law on specific moral issues. By analysing the relevant case-law on the subject of public morals, this thesis aims to identify interpretive patterns in the Court's reasoning in 'hard cases' (cases raising sensitive moral and ethical issues). Based on this analysis of the Court's case-law on moral issues, the thesis aims to discuss whether the Court is interested in the moral values underlying human rights to determine the content of the Convention rights. Importantly, such values depend on substantive moral arguments rather than member states' common interpretation of those values. On this view, the content of the Convention rights depends on principles of political morality. This means that the content of the Convention rights can be interpreted without reference to the will of political majorities across the Council of Europe. This thesis thus aims to show that Dworkin's legal interpretivism can help the European Court of Human Rights in providing substantive moral reasons concerning the purpose and moral value of the Convention rights. This thesis proposes that the European Court of Human Rights can benefit a better understanding of the moral values underlying the Convention rights. Therefore, this thesis aims to discuss how the Court could make use of insights from Dworkin's legal interpretivism to establish the objective content of the Convention rights.",

      "abstract": "Understanding ideological conflict has been a topic of interest in CSCW, for example in Value Sensitive Design research. More specifically, understanding ideological conflict is important for studying social media platforms like Twitter, which provide the ability for people to freely express their thoughts and opinions on contentious political events. In this work, we examine Twitter data to understand the moral, affective, and cognitive differences in language use between two opposing sides of the political debate over immigration related issues in the United States in the year since the 2016 presidential election. In total, we analyzed and compared the language of 45,045 pro-immigration tweets and 11,213 anti-immigration tweets spread across this period. Based on Moral Foundations Theory used to understand ideological conflict, we found pro-immigration tweets to contain more language associated with moral foundations of harm, fairness, and loyalty. Anti-immigration tweets contained more language associated with moral foundations of authority, more words associated with cognitive rigidity and more 3rd person pronouns and negative emotion. We discuss the implications of our research for political communication over social media, and for incorporating Moral Foundations Theory into other CSCW research. We discuss the potential application of this theory for Value Sensitive Design research.",

In this study, we present a unique demographically representative dataset of 15k US residents that combines technology use logs with surveys on moral views, human values, and emotional contagion. Combining these data, we provide a holistic view of individuals to model their physical exercise behavior. First, we show which values determine the adoption of Health &amp; Fitness mobile applications, finding that users who prioritize the value of purity and de-emphasize values of conformity, hedonism, and security are more likely to use such apps. Further, we achieve a weighted AUROC of .673 in predicting whether individual exercises, and we also show that the application usage data allows for substantially better classification performance (.608) compared to using basic demographics (.513) or internet browsing data (.546). We also find a strong link of exercise to respondent socioeconomic status, as well as the value of happiness. Using these insights, we propose actionable design guidelines for persuasive technologies targeting health behavior modification.",

Given the variable nature of human moral values, AI algorithms will have to adjust their behaviour based on the moral values of its users in order to align with end user expectations. Quantifying human moral values is, however, a challenging task which cannot easily be completed using e.g. surveys. In order to address this problem, we propose the use of game theory in longitudinal mobile sensing deployments. Game theory has long been used in disciplines such as Economics to quantify human preferences by asking participants to choose between a set of hypothetical options and outcomes. The behaviour observed in these games, combined with the use of mobile sensors, enables researchers to obtain unique insights into the effect of context on participant convictions.",

However, state-of-the-art social dilemmas have disregarded specific ethical aspects affecting interactions. Here we propose a novel model for social dilemmas, the so-called Sequential Moral Dilemmas, that do capture the notion of moral value. First, we provide a formal definition of sequential moral dilemmas as Markov Games. Thereafter, we formally characterise the necessary and sufficient conditions for agents to learn to behave ethically, so that they are aligned with the moral value. Moreover, we exploit our theoretical characterisation to provide a structural solution to a sequential moral dilemma, namely how to configure the Markov game to solve the dilemma. Finally, we illustrate our proposal through the so-called public civility game, an example of a sequential moral dilemma considering the civility value. We show the social benefits obtained when the agents learn to adhere to the moral value.",

This study is the first to gain deeper insights into writers' intent behind digital misinformation by analyzing psycholinguistic signals: moral foundations and connotations extracted from different types of deceptive news ranging from strategic disinformation to propaganda and hoaxes. To ensure consistency of our findings and generalizability across domains, we experiment with data from: (1) confirmed cases of disinformation in news summaries, (2) propaganda, hoax, and disinformation news pages, and (3) social media news. We first contrast lexical markers of biased language, syntactic and stylistic signals, and connotations across deceptive news types including disinformation, propaganda, and hoaxes, and deceptive strategies including misleading or falsification. We then incorporate these insights to build machine learning and deep learning predictive models to infer deception strategies and deceptive news types. Our experimental results demonstrate that unlike earlier work on deception detection, content combined with biased language markers, moral foundations, and connotations leads to better predictive performance of deception strategies compared to syntactic and stylistic signals (as reported in earlier work on deceptive reviews). Falsification strategy is easier to identify than misleading strategy. Disinformation is more difficult to predict than to propaganda or hoaxes. Deceptive news types (disinformation, propaganda, and hoaxes), unlike deceptive strategies (falsification and misleading), are more salient, and thus easier to identify in tweets than in news reports. Finally, our novel connotation analysis across deception types provides deeper understanding of writers' perspectives and therefore reveals the intentions behind digital misinformation.",

This study aimed to identify physiological markers of moral decisions and non-moral decisions using infrared thermal imaging (ITI). ITI is a non-invasive tool used to capture thermal variations due to blood flow in specific body regions that might be caused by sympathetic activity. Results show that moral decisions seem to elicit a significant decrease in temperature in the chin region 20 seconds after participants are presented with a moral decision. However, given the small sample involved, and the lack of significance in other regions, future studies might be needed to confirm the results obtained in this work.",

The paper considers four dimensions of this issue: what, why, which, and how. The main thesis is that we need to build not just emotional intelligence, but also ersatz emotions, in autonomous social robots. Moral sentimentalism and moral functionalism are employed as the theoretical models. However, this paper argues that the popularly endorsed moral sentiment empathy is the wrong model to implement in social robots. In its stead, I propose the four moral sentiments (commiseration, shame/disgust, respect and deference, and the sense of right and wrong) in Confucian moral sentimentalism as our starting point for the top-down affective structure of robot design.",

      "abstract": "From the Publisher:The Great Disruption begins by observing that over the past thirty years, the United States and other developed countries have undergone a profound transformation from industrial to information societies; knowledge has replaced mass production as the basis of wealth, power, and social interaction. At the same time, Western societies have endured increasing levels of crime, massive changes in fertility and family structure, decreasing levels of trust, and the triumph of individualism over community. Just as the Industrial Revolution brought about momentous changes in society's moral values, a similar Great Disruption in our own time has caused profound changes in our social structure. Drawing on the latest sociological data and new theoretical models from fields as diverse as economics and biology, Fukuyama reveals that even though the old order has broken apart, a new social order is already taking shape. Indeed, he suggests, the Great Disruption of the 1960s and 1970s may be giving way to a Great Reconstruction, as Western society weaves a new fabric of social and moral values appropriate to the changed realities of the postindustrial world.",

We show how the Interpretation Problem in Artificial Intelligence is an illustration of Wittgenstein’s general claim that no rule can contain the criteria for its own application, and that the risks created by this problem escalates in proportion to the degree to which a machine is causally connected to the world, in what we call the Law of Interpretative Exposure. Using games as an illustration, we attempt to define the structure of normative spaces and argue that any rule-following within a normative space is guided by values that are external to that space and which cannot themselves be represented as rules. In light of this, we categorise the types of mistakes an artificial moral agent could make into Mistakes of Intention and Instrumental Mistakes, and we propose ways of building morality into machines by getting them to interpret the rules we give in accordance with these external values, through explicit moral reasoning, the “Show, not Tell” paradigm, the adjustment of causal power and structure of the agent, and relational values, with the ultimate aim that the machine develop a virtuous character and that the impact of the Interpretation Problem is minimised.",

Think of self-driving cars, companion robots, and medical diagnosis support systems. We also believe that humans and machines will often need to work together and agree on common decisions. Thus hybrid collective decision making systems will be in great need.In this scenario, both machines and collective decision making systems should follow some form of moral values and ethical principles (appropriate to where they will act but always aligned to humans'), as well as safety constraints. In fact, humans would accept and trust more machines that behave as ethically as other humans in the same environment. Also, these principles would make it easier for machines to determine their actions and explain their behavior in terms understandable by humans. Moreover, often machines and humans will need to make decisions together, either through consensus or by reaching a compromise. This would be facilitated by shared moral values and ethical principles.",

      "abstract": "This book offers the first systematic guide to machine ethics, bridging between computer science, social sciences and philosophy. Based on a dialogue between an AI scientist and a novelist philosopher, the book discusses important findings on which moral values machines can be taught and how. In turn, it investigates what kind of artificial intelligence (AI) people do actually want. What are the main consequences of the integration of AI in people's every-day life? In order to co-exist and collaborate with humans, machines need morality, but which moral values should we teach them? Moreover, how can we implement benevolent AI? These are just some of the questions carefully examined in the book, which offers a comprehensive account of ethical issues concerning AI, on the one hand, and a timely snapshot of the power and potential benefits of this technology on the other. Starting with an introduction to common-sense ethical principles, the book then guides the reader, helping them develop and understand more complex ethical concerns and placing them in a larger, technological context. The book makes these topics accessible to a non-expert audience, while also offering alternative reading pathways to inspire more specialized readers.",

In this study, we employ Moral Foundations Theory to examine the relationship between moral principles and toxicity in OSS. Specifically, we analyze toxic communications in GitHub issue threads to identify and understand five types of moral principles exhibited in text, and explore their potential association with toxic behavior. Our preliminary findings suggest a possible link between moral principles and toxic comments in OSS communications, with each moral principle associated with at least one type of toxicity.

From this, the conclusion is drawn that “more” behavioural science research on user psychology can save the CBS-managerial decision-support concept. However, the underlying design ideal of CBS and the assumption of rational decision-making within organizations remains unquestioned. Any moves to question this ideal generally rest upon the issues of tool design in terms of providing alternative modes of information presentation in response to psychological “user types” and  problem categories.This paper questions the ideals of rational managerial decision-making and the resulting paradigm of computer system support. It suggests that for effective support, the normative content (the political and moral foundations) of system design must be subject to critical appraisal to secure social rationality for use of CBS within organizational activities.",

Although this concept has been extensively studied in social philosophy and in social sciences, it has been far less studied in the field of deontic logic and multi-agent systems (MASs). We discuss different aspects of moral agency such as the distinction between desires and moral values and the concept of moral agent. All these concepts are formalized in a variant of STIT logic with explicit actions.",

In this paper we present EXPRI, an agent architecture that aims to assist users in managing multi-user privacy conflicts. By considering the personal utility of sharing content and the individually preferred moral values of each user involved in the conflict, EXPRI identifies the best collaborative solution by applying practical reasoning techniques.

      "abstract": "Today's information systems are ubiquitous and delivered through \"mobile apps\" installed on smartphones. However, the growth of smartphone apps has had relatively little impact on the creation of apps that offer new affordances for young people from marginalised groups. One possible determining factor for this is the specific issue of value sensitivity. It is also evident that the role of software engineering is integral to addressing issues that require inter-connection and human interactions with systems. Thus, software engineering needs to integrate research in socio-technical systems, human behaviour and social concerns when used for design of mobile device based apps. Such integration requires a renewed focus on the notion of \"Value\".A basic driver of human behaviour may at least in part be explained by (moral) values. Friedman defines value as: \"what a person or group of people consider important in life\". Values that are particularly pertinent to information systems include: ownership and property; privacy, freedom from bias, universal usability, trust, autonomy, informed consent, identity and others [2]. A notable contribution to understanding and accounting for values in the design process is the work by Friedman and her colleagues on Value Sensitive Design (VSD)[2]. Apps addressing social concerns are particularly prone to value sensitive concerns.This work proposes that mobile app systems design and current SE practice does not incorporate any theoretical perspective of value as a first class representation. In particular, apps targeted for social good need software engineering guidance as current approaches to non-functional requirements are insufficient. This paper will present the outcomes of a research study that developed and deployed a mobile app for use by young people and their caseworkers in youth offending teams in the UK youth justice domain (http://www.mayot.mdx.ac.uk). The project raised requirements on design methods to incorporate the voice of stakeholders with respect to privacy and other moral value issues. The research was conducted \"in the wild\" and the app was deployed and evaluated in three case study sites.Several contributions are made: we will present our app; the novel design processes; and some of our evaluation outcomes. Critically, we will expose some of the key research challenges arising from this work as we integrated value sensitive concerns into our co-design processes. We discuss the implications for mobile software engineering practice particularly in the context of non functional requirements. In doing so, we will refer to our prior published at ICSE 2015 [1] and our current work on further empirical evaluation of the app in 12 other case study organisations.",

In this article I outline some distinctions that are useful for understanding the value alignment problem and then propose a solution: I argue that the methods currently applied by computer scientists for embedding moral values in autonomous systems can be improved by representing moral principles as conceptual spaces, i.e. as Voronoi tessellations of morally similar choice situations located in a multidimensional geometric space. The advantage of my preferred geometric approach is that it can be implemented without specifying any utility function ex ante.",

The approach presented in this paper takes information from a common tool of sociologists, public surveys, as input to build the model by following a data-driven approach, to analyse and interpret the impact of each factor separately, and their mutual influence. The system handles thousands of heterogeneous agents, with their own life cycle, reproduction patterns and complex social relationship dynamics including friendship. The emergence of a robust social network was a consequence of the system set up. Its output is consistent with respect to the ideological, religious and demographic parameters observed in real world surveys.",

However, the adoption of these methodologies by industry has been slower than desirable. This paper seeks to uncover potential reasons behind this slow adoption by investigating the concept of \"values\" among individuals working as designers in various industries. Based on a survey of these design industry professionals, this paper reports that design professionals believe they do consider values in their design and hence may not see a need for a specific value-sensitive methodology. While design professionals clearly consider personal, social, and economic values in their work, there may be a lack of consideration of moral values.

      "abstract": "Ethics education is essential in business and STEM curricula. For decades up to the present day, a rationalist conception of ethics has been highly influential in its pedagogy. However, in the past twenty years, developments in moral psychology and neuroscience support that moral thought and deliberation are guided by a dual process initiated by intuition. In this research, we present the design of a scaffolding for ethics teaching based on groupware with individual and collaborative activities, informed by the Social Intuitionist Model (SIM) and Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). We conducted an exploratory study based on an original case about academic ethics, involving student samples in five higher education institutions in four countries (N = 249). Results indicate that ethical reasoning, initially guided by intuition, can be influenced by facts, reflective questions, and social interaction. Students regardless of their initial intuitive stance about an eliciting situation, and their moral sensitivity according to MFT, changed their final decision on the situation significantly by the end of the intervention according to a Wilcoxon signed rank test (p &lt; 0.001). About 30% of the sample swung to a stance opposite to what they decided at the outset of the intervention. A question that stems from this research is how students’ ethical thinking could be scaffolded and oriented, both pedagogically and technology-wise, towards identifying and standing for solutions to ethical dilemmas that are based on virtue and bring greater good.",

      "abstract": "The infrastructure underlying the Internet continues to evolve, with ramifications for not only the technical protocols that govern network functions, but also implications for social, economic, and legal issues. This paper uses ethnography to examine how and why ethical and social issues arise during the design of Named Data Networking, a new approach to Internet architecture. By focusing on communications modes among a distributed team of network architects, it investigates how particular modes may enable or constrain values levers: practices which encourage discussion of values during design. While face-to-face retreats encourage interdisciplinary work and subsequent discussion of moral values, mediated modes of communication tend to constrain values levers. These limitations may be overcome by encouraging communications techniques such as scenarios and demos, which can be used in both face-to-face and mediated settings.",

      "abstract": "This paper uses two recent\nworks as a springboard for discussing the\nproper contours of intellectual property\nprotection.  Professor Lessig devotes much of\nThe Future of Ideas to demonstrating how\nthe expanding scope of intellectual property\nprotection threatens the Internet as an\ninnovation commons.  Similarly, Professor\nLitman's message in Digital Copyright is\nthat copyright law is both too complicated and\ntoo restrictive.  Both authors contend that as\na result of overprotecting individual rights,\ncreativity is stifled and the vitality of the\nintellectual commons is in jeopardy.  It is\ndifficult to evaluate the claims and policy\nprescriptions of these books without some\nappreciation for the moral foundations of\nintellectual property.  The utility and labor\ndesert theories remain the two most prominent\nin the Anglo-American tradition.  After\nexploring those theories, we argue for a secure\nregime of protection based on the Lockean\nvision that property rights are justly deserved\nas a reward for labor that creates value. \nHowever, as Locke's famous proviso implies,\neven a natural property right is not absolute\nand must be balanced by regard for the public\ndomain.  But a natural right cannot be\nsacrificed simply to advance technological\ninnovation or to achieve marginal social and\neconomic gains.  While we agree with Lessig and\nLitman that recent legislation goes too far we\nconclude the essay by attempting to illustrate\nthat some of their policy recommendations err\nin the opposite direction by underprotecting\nvalid property rights.",

      "abstract": "Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have profoundly changed many aspects of life, including the nature of entertainment, work, communication, education, healthcare, industrial production and business, social relations and conflicts. They have had a radical and widespread impact on our moral lives and hence on contemporary ethical debates. The Cambridge Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics provides an ambitious and authoritative introduction to the field, with discussions of a range of topics including privacy, ownership, freedom of speech, responsibility, technological determinism, the digital divide, cyber warfare, and online pornography. It offers an accessible and thoughtful survey of the transformations brought about by ICTs and their implications for the future of human life and society, for the evaluation of behaviour, and for the evolution of moral values and rights. It will be a valuable book for all who are interested in the ethical aspects of the information society in which we live.",

      "abstract": "Research in normative multi-agent systems has explored several approaches to compute the norm system (set of norms) required to make coordination possible. More recently, norm selection supposes an already available collection of norms from which to select a norm system to enact. A key aspect in this selection process is the consideration of moral values together with preferences among them, thus the selection follows the principle: the more preferred the values promoted by a norm system, the more preferred the norm system. Unfortunately, norm selection follows a quantitative approach despite the qualitative nature of the information available to the decision maker. In this paper we provide a novel qualitative approach to norm selection by formalising the process to infer a norm system ranking from the value preferences. We provide an encoding of this qualitative problem into a linear program and show that their solutions are equivalent.",

Scholars proposed collaborative mechanisms to support users, but they did not satisfy one or more requirements needed according to empirical evidence in this domain, such as explainability, role-agnosticism, adaptability, and being utility- and value-driven. We present ELVIRA, an agent that supports multiuser privacy, whose design meets all these requirements. By considering the sharing preferences and the moral values of users, ELVIRA identifies the optimal sharing policy. Furthermore, ELVIRA justifies the optimality of the solution through explanations based on argumentation. We prove via simulations that ELVIRA provides solutions with the best trade-off between individual utility and value adherence. We also show through a user study that ELVIRA suggests solutions that are more acceptable than existing approaches and that its explanations are also more satisfactory.",

Field study findings demonstrate that American individuals across a demographic range have internalized a cultural emphasis of busyness as a moral value to construct positive identities as busy individuals. At the same time, they struggle with a sense of conflict around busyness, reflected in real-life experiences of clashing priorities, fantasies of downtime, and struggles with anxiety, guilt, and loss of control. Our findings also point to the ways digital and non-digital productivity tools are embedded in experiences and coping practices around busyness. Grounded in our observations we propose design principles for productivity tools that support users' identities as busy people but also address some of the perils of the American busyness ethic.",

      "abstract": "Drawing on Berman's (1972, 1988) political-cultural view of creativity, this thesis contextualizes consumer creativity in the context of a consumer community wrought with paradoxes and conflicts. Adopting a netnography methodology and empirically examining how individual free/open source software (FOSS) community members interpret their own creative activities, this thesis finds that consumer creativity is a journey toward a moral destiny, with morality arising from the interplay between rationalism and Romanticism and the cultural, historical baggage of these two ideological systems (e.g., sexism in the domains of science and art). Along this journey, individual FOSS community members (i.e., FOSS programmers) co-create and negotiate their common identity—a craftsperson who is a scientist, artist, and moral warrior, an identity embodied by FOSS, their creative product and a form of technology. This journey is both sweet and bitter and full of paradoxes and conflicts, all of which have rich implications about the power relationships within the community. On the one hand, FOSS programmers recreate a mythologized paradise where they re-merge with the natural world and return to human nature and where they are re-actualizing the moral values of freedom, public interests, and egalitarianism. On the other hand, in this community, sexism against female programmers is rampant; some programmers could perceive that their creativity is constrained and exploited by powerful project owners and thereby feel alienated, frustrated, and trivialized; individual programmers could confront each other due to their different technological preferences and doubt each other's motivations; and this community's creative process is infused with politics.This thesis (1) enriches the marketing literature on consumer creativity which is dominated by an instrumental perspective of creativity by introducing the moral dimension of consumer creativity; (2) contributes to the marketing literature which is dominated by the view that the creative process is enjoyable and harmonious by examining paradoxes and conflicts in the creative process; and (3) enriches the marketing literature on the impact of technology on human well-being and the natural environment by illustrating a contextualized view that the impact of a technology depends on the moral values of the creator and the user of this technology.",

While a growing chorus of recent papers has kindled interest in so-called “participatory ML” methods, precisely what form participation ought to take and how to operationalize these ambitions are seldom addressed. Our survey of the relevant literature shows that in many papers, participation is reduced to highly structured, computational mechanisms designed to elicit mathematically tractable approximations of narrowly-defined moral values. Of papers that actually engage with real people, these engagements typically consist of one-time interactions with individuals that are often unrepresentative of the relevant stakeholders. Motivated by these clear limitations, we introduce a consolidated set of axes to evaluate and improve participatory approaches. We use these axes to analyze contemporary work in this space and outline future AI research directions that could meaningfully contribute to operationalizing the ideal of participation.",

Drawing on part one, part two provides a discussion of what I consider to be the main conceptual and practical difficulties facing Floridi's IE theory. Although in agreement with the overall motivation and objective that informs Floridi's IE position, namely, that \"all entities, qua informational objects, have an intrinsic moral value'\" and that \"there seems to be no good reason not to adopt a higher and more inclusive, ontocentric [moral] perspective\" Floridi, 2007, 10, part three of the paper proposes an alternative New-Gewirthian approach to Information Ethics that avoids some if not all of the difficulties facing Floridi's own position. Part four then examines the implications for Floridi's metaphysical theory of information ethics and finally, offers a conclusion in part five.",

      "abstract": "Value sensitive design is a new method to embed moral value into the design process and possesses broad research prospects. However, there is a gap between the industrial application and the practical application of VSD since its practical application focuses on human-computer interaction and medical ethics. In this paper, the conceptual, empirical, and technical investigation of VSD are analyzed, and the feasibility of VSD for production line design is demonstrated. It was applied to the production line design process in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China. Then, specific design issues such as environmental sustainability and safety are solved by analyzing the value demands of stakeholders and balancing the value tension. Thus, the human value of the production line becomes more sensitive, and the value conflict between natural and technical artifact is alleviated. In this process, we reflect on the design problems to be solved and obtain valuable opinions, enabling VSD to better adapt to the industrial production line design.",

      "abstract": "Organizations such as the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI and the IEEE have recently formulated ethical principles and (moral) values that should be adhered to in the design and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI). These include respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, fairness, transparency, explainability, and accountability. But how can we ensure and verify that an AI system actually respects these values? To help answer this question, I propose an account for determining when an AI system can be said to embody certain values. This account understands embodied values as the result of design activities intended to embed those values in such systems. AI systems are here understood as a special kind of sociotechnical system that, like traditional sociotechnical systems, are composed of technical artifacts, human agents, and institutions but—in addition—contain artificial agents and certain technical norms that regulate interactions between artificial agents and other elements of the system. The specific challenges and opportunities of embedding values in AI systems are discussed, and some lessons for better embedding values in AI systems are drawn.",

Among the most challenging concerns when imparting shared values like accountability, transparency, liberty, fairness and trust into information technology are reliable and comprehensive formal and computational models of those values. This paper, educated by trust theories and models from cognitive science, social sciences and artificial intelligence, proposes a novel stochastic computational model of trust, encapsulating abstractions of human cognitive capabilities and empirically evidenced social interaction patterns. Qualitative and quantitative features of trust are identified, upon which our formal model is phrased. Reality mining methods are used to validate the model based on a real life community dataset. We analyze the time-varying dynamics of the interaction and communication patterns of the community, consider varying types of relationships as well as their symmetry. Social network data analysis shows that our model better fits the evolved friendships compared to a well designed synthetic trust model, which is used as the baseline.",

While most studies have focused on organisations’ employees as threats, only a few have focused on the role the outsourced employees’ play as a potential threat. The study seeks to investigate the insider threat behaviour of an outsourced employee in developing countries as security threats to information systems by virtue of their privileged access. The study is quantitative and adopts social bond and involvement theories for this purpose. The research sample was chosen from organisations in Nigeria and South Africa which are the largest two national economies in Africa. Close-ended questionnaires were used and the data were analysed using factor analysis. The study found that outsourced employees exploit information systems vulnerabilities because they are not actively involved in the organisation and lack moral values and beliefs. The findings of this study will assist organisations in developing countries to mitigate the information security threats posed by outsourced employees.",

A series of studies supports the hypotheses put forward by ANT: that in European American cultural contexts, (H1) observers notice affective deviance and (H2) negatively evaluate individuals who display deviant affect, that (H3) one reason affective displays are so powerful is because observers can use deviant displays to draw inferences about moral values, and that (H4) observers narrow the range of affective expressions they find appropriate in response to a stimulus when they interpret it as having moral content. Discussion focuses on the role of beliefs about the meaning of affective displays, individual difference measures, and the importance of gender and cultural context in defining and understanding affective norms and expectations.",

      "abstract": "Multiuser Privacy (MP) concerns the protection of personal information in situations where such information is co-owned by multiple users. MP is particularly problematic in collaborative platforms such as online social networks (OSN). In fact, too often OSN users experience privacy violations due to conflicts generated by other users sharing content that involves them without their permission. Previous studies show that in most cases MP conflicts could be avoided, and are mainly due to the difficulty for the uploader to select appropriate sharing policies. For this reason, we present ELVIRA, the first fully explainable personal assistant that collaborates with other ELVIRA agents to identify the optimal sharing policy for a collectively owned content. An extensive evaluation of this agent through software simulations and two user studies suggests that ELVIRA, thanks to its properties of being role-agnostic, adaptive, explainable and both utility- and value-driven, would be more successful at supporting MP than other approaches presented in the literature in terms of (i) trade-off between generated utility and promotion of moral values, and (ii) users’ satisfaction of the explained recommended output.",

Nonetheless, personality disorders are diagnosed with astounding frequency and ubiquity and with substantial consequences for patients. In this dissertation, I draw from ethics, philosophy of medicine, history of philosophy, and aesthetics to explain how personality disorders remain tenacious, compelling concepts despite their weaknesses. An extended philosophical examination of personality disorder concepts demonstrates that these diagnoses are indebted to medical, moral, and aesthetic values. I further argue that personality disorder concepts approximate diagnoses of the self. Therefore psychiatry, in diagnosing personality disorders, articulates a thin moral consensus regarding modern, Western selfhood that is indebted to a particular history of ethical, theistic, scientific, and aesthetic commitments. My research demonstrates the radical cultural specificity of personality pathology. Furthermore, efforts to reduce personality disorder nosology to the strictly scientific are doomed to failure because they inappropriately truncate our concept of self. Rather than denying the value-ladenness of personality pathology, I argue that psychiatry ought to embrace its aesthetic and moral values as potential (albeit dangerously powerful) resources for care and healing.",

      "abstract": "Intuitively, many people seem to hold that engaging in acts of virtual murder in videogames is morally permissible, whereas engaging in acts of virtual child molestation is morally impermissible. The Gamer’s Dilemma (Luck in Ethics Inf Technol 11:31–36, 2009) challenges these intuitions by arguing that it is unclear whether there is a morally relevant difference between these two types of virtual actions. There are two main responses in the literature to this dilemma. First, attempts to resolve the dilemma by defending an account of the relevant moral differences between virtual murder and virtual child molestation. Second, attempts to dissolve the dilemma by undermining the intuitions that ground it. In this paper, we argue that a narrow version of the Gamer’s Dilemma seems to survive attempts to resolve or dissolve it away entirely, since neither approach seems to be able to solve the dilemma for all cases. We thus provide a contextually sensitive version of the dilemma that more accurately tracks onto the intuitions of gamers. However, we also argue that the intuitions that ground the narrow version of the Dilemma may not have a moral foundation, and we put forward alternative non-moral normative foundations that seem to better account for the remaining intuitive difference between the two types of virtual actions. We also respond to proposed solutions to the Gamer’s Dilemma in novel ways and set out areas for future empirical work in this area.",

      "abstract": "This dissertation sought to test the psychometric validity of assessing adolescent moral intuitions using the Character Foundations Survey (CFS). The CFS was developed using a theoretical structure based on moral foundations theory (MFT), and previous research validated its use in assessing adult populations. Results presented here suggest the CFS was able to only partially capture the structure of moral intuitions in early adolescents. MFT factors of animal physical, autonomy, and loyalty retained their structure while ratings of other items seemed to be more influenced by affective factors rather than the categorical domain distinctions that characterized the structure of adult moral intuitions. A new instrument was developed based on these three factors, the 3-Factor Character Foundations Survey (CFS-3). A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was used to search for latent factor mean differences between several age and sex groups using the CFS-3. Results indicated that 11–12-year-old females had higher factor means in all three latent factors when compared to 11–12-year-old males. Eleven-12-year-old males showed no difference in latent factor means when compared to 13–14-year-old males. However, the latent factor mean of the loyalty factor of 13–14-year-old females was significantly less than the latent factor mean of 11–12-year-old females—resulting in no difference in latent factor mean between 13–14-year-old females and 13–14-year-old males in that factor. Thirteen-14-year-old females retained higher latent factor means in the animal physical and autonomy factors when compared to 13–14-year-old males. An attempt is made to explain these results based on theory from adolescent moral development research, and possible future directions are discussed.",

This calls for increased dataset documentation, e.g., using datasheets. They, among other topics, encourage to reflect on the composition of the datasets. So far, this documentation, however, is done manually and therefore can be tedious and error-prone, especially for large image datasets. Here we ask the arguably “circular” question of whether a machine can help us reflect on inappropriate content, answering Question 16 in Datasheets. To this end, we propose to use the information stored in pre-trained transformer models to assist us in the documentation process. Specifically, prompt-tuning based on a dataset of socio-moral values steers CLIP to identify potentially inappropriate content, therefore reducing human labor. We then document the inappropriate images found using word clouds, based on captions generated using a vision-language model. The documentations of two popular, large-scale computer vision datasets—ImageNet and OpenImages—produced this way suggest that machines can indeed help dataset creators to answer Question 16 on inappropriate image content.",

      "abstract": "This thesis examines the impact of microcredit on women's livelihoods and relationships in Offinso, an Asante town in Ghana. Based on thirteen months of ethnographic fieldwork, it offers a detailed exploration of the various aspects of women's experience of microcredit. The main argument is that microcredit is predicated on the notion of obligation. The evidence suggests that women's involvement in economic activity, the nature of their relationships with lending institutions, and the outcomes of their interactions within the household, all involve the balancing of obligations to different persons and groups at the same time. Conceptualising women's economic choices in terms of their obligations enables a better understanding of the pragmatic economic choices of the recipients of microcredit. However, the reference to obligation does not imply a total subordination of the individual to social control or moral order. Rather, individuals act in pursuit of their own ethical projects. Indeed, the economic choices of women are sometimes geared towards expanding their freedoms to act in ways that are contrary to traditional moral values about things like marriage and female modesty. This thesis therefore highlights the coexistence of moral obligation and ethical self-formation in the economic conduct of women.",

      "abstract": "We investigate legal and philosophical notions of privacy in the context of artificial agents. Our analysis utilizes a normative account of privacy that defends its value and the extent to which it should be protected: privacy is treated as an interest with moral value, to supplement the legal claim that privacy is a legal right worthy of protection by society and the law. We argue that the fact that the only entity to access my personal data (such as email) is an artificial agent is irrelevant to whether a breach of privacy has occurred. What is relevant are the capacities of the agent: what the agent is both able and empowered to do with that information. We show how concepts of legal agency and attribution of knowledge gained by agents to their principals are crucial to understanding whether a violation of privacy has occurred when artificial agents access users' personal data. As natural language processing and semantic extraction used in artificial agents become increasingly sophisticated, so the corporations that deploy those agents will be more likely to be attributed with knowledge of their users' personal information, thus triggering significant potential legal liabilities.",

The widespread use of CCTV could\ntherefore give rise to individual as well as\nsocial issues, and possibly in a different\nmanner than previous surveillance technologies.\nThis fact signals the need for\n(re-)conceptualisations of moral values (such\nas privacy) applicable to the case of CCTV\nwhich take into account the importance of\nbodily protections.",

Here, following van de Poel and Kroes, I introduce the idea of value sensitive design. Specifically, I show how by virtue of their designed properties, artifacts may come to embody values. Such accounts, however, have several shortcomings. In agreement with Michael Klenk, I raise epistemic and metaphysical issues with respect to designed properties embodying value. The concept of an affordance, borrowed from ecological psychology, provides a more philosophically fruitful grounding to the potential way(s) in which artifacts might embody values. This is due to the way in which it incorporates key insights from perception more generally, and how we go about determining possibilities for action in our environment&nbsp;specifically. The affordance account&nbsp;as it is presented by Klenk,&nbsp;however, is insufficient. I therefore argue that we understand affordances based on whether they are meaningful, and, secondly, that we grade them based on their force.",

But the complexity of school life and teachers' work has been underestimated by the entrepreneurs of educational computing. Theoretically there is a need to approach this area from a different angle. We will suggest there is a need to reframe the issue of ICT in schools with educational policy and discourse with education, rather than with technology in mind. In order to reach that goal there is a need to inculcate \"technology\" as an ordinary part of teachers' vocabulary about their own work and as a part of their professional ethos. Teachers need to examine the moral values inherent in their practices and use those values as bases for debate. Not taking up these issues and instead adopting defensive stances is dangerous to the profession. The danger is that defensiveness can be seen by others outside the school as rigidity and play into the hands of those who are impatient with teachers. It would serve teachers well if they had a more robust ability to communicate the nature of the difficulties they face and how they deal with them.",

Thus, work values are extremely important in the career-development process. Research is necessary because vocational high school students enrol on schemes for personal career development as preparation for entering the workplace, and understanding work values should be an essential part of that preparation. A reliable and valid work-values scale for vocational high school students WVSVS was developed using data from the Survey Research Data Archive at Taiwanese Academia Sinica. The data were derived from 1,710 subjects divided into three sample groups of 570. Data from the first sample group was used for exploratory factor analysis, the second for confirmatory factor analysis and the third as a verification sample for cross-validation. The WVSVS was scored for three work values extrinsic, intrinsic and concomitant values: Extrinsic work values directly describe income, workplace, lifestyle and co-workers; intrinsic work values describe achievement, intellectual stimulation, advancement and interesting work; and concomitant work values explain responsibility, social service and moral values. The WVSVS could be used by teachers for guiding and understanding vocational high school students' work values in preparation for entering the workplace.",

The value orientation framework is designed to examine three major dimensions of human relationships, namely, \"man and himself\", \"man and society\", and \"man and nature\". The aim of the framework is to evaluate the themes in junior high Chinese textbooks. The classification of moral value orientation reveals that China's national guidelines paid significant attention to the cultivation of students' morality, aesthetics, and appreciation of nature. Nonetheless, the researcher noticed that but there was a lack of themes such as the virtue of thriftiness, emphasis on innovation, and the concept of ecological sustainability. Moreover, the interpretation of the value orientation in these textbooks lacks contemporaneity. Furthermore, hot topics such as the inequality between men and women, which is prevalent in certain provincial and rural areas of China were also not listed in the national guidelines on junior high textbooks The discussion, which is stemmed from an analysis of the framework derived from \"The Compulsory Education Chinese Curriculum Standards (2011 edition)\", and the \"Core Competence in Chinese Student Development (revised in 2016)\" is believed to be good references to all educational stakeholders, especially the curriculum panels of China's junior high textbooks.",

      "abstract": "Issues relating to ethics and how moral principles evolve are imminently engrained in culture. Culture and technology cannot be separated from one another, as both are processes and reflections of social cognition and experience through action and practice. Technology is the embodiment of values and enabler of culture. As technology develops and human relationships to information technology (IT) become ever more intricate and intimate the cultural framework underpinning values and ethics also morphs. The Internet is everywhere and humans are reliant on it for everything from banking to maintaining family relationships. Anything an individual could possibly desire can be found within the masses of information and websites. The Internet has made access to domains that were either rare luxury or forbidden seemingly easy, convenient and free. What was once considered taboo and hedonic indulgence is now not only openly available, but widely accepted within popular Western culture. This paper concentrates on the topic of technosexuality, Internet facilitated sexual encounters, technologically enabled sex, and ideas around ethics and changing moral values. We refer to ‘ethical stance’ as a reflection of the socio-psychological positioning of humans in relation to their moral views and understandings. This is a theoretical paper that draws on contemporary examples from dating Apps and embodied technology (sex robots) in light of current discourse expressed in public online media.",

Moral values and moral ideals For young college students, only by understanding and loving beauty can they realize the moral pursuit of beauty and consciously create beauty according to the laws of beauty. This article aims to study the role of music education based on big data in promoting ideological and moral education of college students. In terms of methods, by establishing the status of music education in the comprehensive development education of college students, the role of music education in the IAP education of college students can be improved. Attention to the influence of the environment makes it easier for college students to accept IAP education. After preliminary screening, 500 students from multiple universities were surveyed, and 426 valid questionnaires were returned. It is concluded that less than half of the students are interested in ideological education and music. 82.6% of students think that music education promotes ideological and moral education.",

      "abstract": "One of the main lines of research in algorithmic fairness involves individual fairness (IF) methods. Individual fairness is motivated by an intuitive principle, similar treatment, which requires that similar individuals be treated similarly. IF offers a precise account of this principle using distance metrics to evaluate the similarity of individuals. Proponents of individual fairness have argued that it gives the correct definition of algorithmic fairness, and that it should therefore be preferred to other methods for determining fairness. I argue that individual fairness cannot serve as a definition of fairness. Moreover, IF methods should not be given priority over other fairness methods, nor used in isolation from them. To support these conclusions, I describe four in-principle problems for individual fairness as a definition and as a method for ensuring fairness: (1) counterexamples show that similar treatment (and therefore IF) are insufficient to guarantee fairness; (2) IF methods for learning similarity metrics are at risk of encoding human implicit bias; (3) IF requires prior moral judgments, limiting its usefulness as a guide for fairness and undermining its claim to define fairness; and (4) the incommensurability of relevant moral values makes similarity metrics impossible for many tasks. In light of these limitations, I suggest that individual fairness cannot be a definition of fairness, and instead should be seen as one tool among several for ameliorating algorithmic bias.",

      "abstract": "Politicians and engineers are increasingly realizing that values are important in the development of technological artefacts. What is often overlooked is that different conceptualizations of these abstract values lead to different design-requirements. For example, designing social media platforms for deliberative democracy sets us up for technical work on completely different types of architectures and mechanisms than designing for so-called liquid or direct forms of democracy. Thinking about Democracy is not enough, we need to design for the proper conceptualization of these values. As we see it, we cannot responsibly engineer and innovate and shape technology in accordance with our moral values without engaging in systematic and continuous conceptual engineering: This is not only an academic, or theoretical issue, it is also not simply an issue for public policy or politics, or regulators, it has become a central problem for engineering and the world of technology. In this paper, we present a framework for doing the necessary conceptual work in the context of requirement engineering. We draw on the literature on conceptual engineering to lay out a methodology to (1) assess different conceptions and (2) to develop new conceptions. Moreover, we integrate this methodology with extant approaches in the philosophy of technology which aim at designing technological artefacts ethically. In the final section we apply this integrated framework to freedom in the context of social media networks.",

      "abstract": "Recent progress in Artificial Intelligence, sensing and network technology, robotics, and (cloud) computing has enabled the development of intelligent autonomous machine systems. Telling such autonomous systems \"what to do\" in a responsible way, is a non-trivial task. For intelligent autonomous machines to function in human society and collaborate with humans, we see three challenges ahead affecting meaningful control of autonomous systems. First, autonomous machines are not yet capable of handling failures and unexpected situations. Providing procedures for all possible failures and situations is unfeasible because the state-action space would explode. Machines should therefore become self-aware (self-assessment, self-management) enabling them to handle unexpected situations when they arise. This is a challenge for the computer science community. Second, in order to keep (meaningful) control, humans come into a new role of providing intelligent autonomous machines with objectives or goal functions (including rules, norms, constraints and moral values), specifying the utility of every possible outcome of actions of autonomous machines. Third, in order to be able to collaborate with humans, autonomous systems will require an understanding of (us) humans (i.e., our social, cognitive, affective and physical behaviors) and the ability to engage in partnership interactions (such as explanations of task performances, and the establishment of joint goals and work agreements). These are new challenges for the cognitive ergonomics community.",

      "abstract": "The question of the moral status of AI and the extent to which that status ought to be recognised by societal institutions is one that has not yet received a satisfactory answer from lawyers. This paper seeks to provide a solution to the problem by defending a moral foundation for the recognition of legal personhood for AI, requiring the status to be granted should a threshold criterion be reached. The threshold proposed will be bare, noumenal agency in the Kantian sense. Agency has been identified by Alan Gewirth as the source of the rights claims of our own species and, at risk of contradiction, is a foundation that must be expanded to all agents or else we contradict the foundation of our own rights. This is something that ought to be recognised through the granting of legal personhood to all noumenal agents by any system that requires such personhood for the enforcement of rights, or else the rule restricting legal personhood cannot be seen as a valid legal norm. Having laid out the case, the paper will move on to defend this natural law conception against the narrower definition of legal personhood proposed by Bryson et al. with regards to AI. It will argue that bare agency is a sufficient, though not necessary, criterion for the ascription of legal personhood in any system that sees the status as necessary for the ascription of legal rights. The paper will conclude by analysing the proposals currently making their way through the legislatures of the UK and European Union. They will be assessed for their compatibility with the claim that a functioning legal system necessarily must recognise the legal personhood of all noumenal agents regardless of their origins, and whether they are future-proofed for the possibility that AI may meet this threshold.",

      "abstract": "Art education implemented in schools so far has not been able to become a means that can develop students' creativity optimally. Art plays a role in constructing taste, processing sensitivity, and becoming a means of self-expression. This can be the key to student success in various ways, including academic improvement. The pandemic era makes art learning done online seem conventional and less interactive. In the new normal era, teachers' strategy of inculcating moral values through art is expected to be well accepted and applied by students. This study discusses the application of art learning through games to encourage students to be more active in learning. The art learning method implemented in this study combines various art performances using the national song Bangun Pemudi Pemuda with collaborative methods (singing, drama, and games). This method was chosen to form connectivity between teachers and students, students and students, and elements of art that blend without any barriers. The type of collaborative performance used aims to test musical understanding and instill character values through the song Bangun Pemudi Pemuda. The object of this research is Kanisius Junior High School students, Temanggung. This research uses qualitative methods with field studies. The results of this study indicate the relationship between the structure of the melody, rhythm, and tone in the song can affect students' creativity and emotions, which has implications for students' character and impacts the academic side of students.",

      "abstract": "While there is a growing literature on moral markets that aim to create social value through market exchange, much of it has focused on how producer activism is able to legitimate new, institutionally complex, organizational and economic forms that are inscribed with competing market and social/community logics. Much less attention has been directed towards understanding how moral markets are scaled by the entry of large, established organizations. While the scaling of moral markets entails the risk of conservative goal transformation, we still know relatively little about how moral values become embedded in markets, providing an ongoing catalyst for social value creation. Based on a five-year ethnographic study, we show how cultural entrepreneurship associated with the creation of a cross-sector partnership, legitimated local food procurement by large, established organizations, enabling the scaling of the overall market. We argue that a key aspect of their success had to do with bridging the institutional void segregating local and industrial food logics. Based on our study, we highlight how this institutional void bridging was facilitated by cultural entrepreneurship that initially focused on communications that decoupled the values and practices associated with the local food logic, and subsequently, reinfused locavore values by valorizing stories and activities that recoupled those values to food procurement practices after the institutional void was diminished. We discuss the implications of our study for research on moral markets and cultural entrepreneurship.",

      "abstract": "An ethical leader is one whose actions and influence processes are consistent with ethical and moral values. Research indicates the effect of the leaders' values on the ethical choices they make. Ethical leadership percolates down to shape the ethical attitudes of people at lower levels, thereby setting the ethical climate of the organization. This paper identifies the imperative for ethical leadership and the manner in which it is manifested in universities and research organizations in India, and suggests an ethical leadership framework for academic and research administrators. The central argument of this paper is that the leader's own value system, attitudes and influence strategies shape employee behavior and set the ethical tone of the organization.This paper is based on literature review and in-depth exploratory interviews with 26 key informants including institutional leaders and members of the top management and middle-level management in four universities and two research organizations in north India. The first part of our ethical leadership framework includes the dimensions of ethical leadership, while the latter part incorporates the outcomes of ethical leadership. The dimensions of ethical leadership include value orientation, attitudes and influence strategies of the leader. The outcomes of ethical leadership are discussed at three levels of organizational behavior, namely, the individual (micro), the work group (meso) and the organization (macro). This paper recommends strategies for research and education planners, policy makers and administrators to build ethical leadership amongst researchers and academics.",

      "abstract": "I argue that the problem of `moral luck' is an unjustly neglected topic within Computer Ethics. This is unfortunate given that the very nature of computer technology, its `logical malleability', leads to ever greater levels of complexity, unreliability and uncertainty. The ever widening contexts of application in turn lead to greater scope for the operation of chance and the phenomenon of moral luck. Moral luck bears down most heavily on notions of professional responsibility, the identification and attribution of responsibility. It is immunity from luck that conventionally marks out moral value from other kinds of values such as instrumental, technical, and use value. The paper describes the nature of moral luck and its erosion of the scope of responsibility and agency. Moral luck poses a challenge to the kinds of theoretical approaches often deployed in Computer Ethics when analyzing moral questions arising from the design and implementation of information and communication technologies. The paper considers the impact on consequentialism; virtue ethics; and duty ethics. In addressing cases of moral luck within Computer Ethics, I argue that it is important to recognise the ways in which different types of moral systems are vulnerable, or resistant, to moral luck. Different resolutions are possible depending on the moral framework adopted. Equally, resolution of cases will depend on fundamental moral assumptions. The problem of moral luck in Computer Ethics should prompt us to new ways of looking at risk, accountability and responsibility.",

      "abstract": "The task of discrimination in war is a non-static phenomenon. It changes with the character of war, which itself changes with developments in cultures, international relations, how states organise for war, innovations in doctrines, technologies and tactics etc. Fundamental changes to war's character necessitate some moral revision, and modern asymmetric conflict (MAC) is the latest fundamental change. MAC is characterised by forces from developed countries fighting unconventional, often non-state adversaries that flout moral and legal norms, and deliberately exploit immoral, unlawful and repugnant tactics. My analysis of the relevant ethics of Paul Ramsey, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops and James Turner Johnson - which, respectively, treats the form of war most similar to MAC, addresses an earlier fundamental change in the character of war, and comprises an important assessment of MAC - as well as touching on other Christian and secular contributions, discerns that there is insufficient Christian moral guidance to address the questions raised about discrimination in MAC. Thinking out of Christian just-war tradition, I focus on the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) network to expose novel ethical issues concerning discrimination in MAC. I argue that by not revealing their combatant status, those enabling the prosecution of IED attacks, and by extension broader combat functions, should lose or at least jeopardise any absolute non-combatant immunity.  I then proceed to explain how conventional forces can discriminate morally, while their irregular and less scrupulous adversaries do not. This includes enhancing the rule of double effect by exploiting predictive analytics; overcoming the enemy's erosion of non-combatant immunity and the inviolability of national borders; empowering soldiers to act discriminately through a simple, moral foundation; equalising the legal accountability of the opposing forces, rather than unfairly pursuing soldiers only from developed countries; and, finally, establishing a level of military supererogation that reflects this new form of conflict, where minimising civilian casualties is a key measure of success.",

      "abstract": "The popularity of some recent applications of AI has given rise to some concerns in society about the risks of AI. One response to these concerns has been the orientation of scientific and technological efforts towards a responsible development of AI. This stance has been articulated from different perspectives. One is to focus on the risks associated with the autonomy of artificial entities, and one way of making this focus operational is the “value-alignment problem”&nbsp;(VAP); namely, to study how this autonomy may become provably aligned with certain moral values. With this purpose in mind, we advocate the characterisation of a problem archetype to study how values may be imbued in autonomous artificially intelligent entities. The motivation is twofold, on one hand to decompose a complex problem to study simpler elements and, on the other, the successful precedents of this artifice in analogous contexts (e.g.&nbsp;chess for cognitive AI, RoboCup for intelligent robotics). We propose to use agent-based modelling of policy-making for this purpose because policy-making (i)&nbsp;constitutes a problem domain that is rich, accessible and evocative, (ii)&nbsp;one may claim that it is an essentially value-drive process and, (iii)&nbsp;it allows for a crisp differentiation of two complementary views of VAP: imbuing values in agents and imbuing values in the social system in order to foster value-aligned behaviour of the agents that act within the system. In this paper we elaborate the former argument, propose a characterisation of the archetype and identify research lines that may be systematically studied with this archetype.",

      "abstract": "Through the exponential growth in digital devices and computational capabilities, big data technologies are putting pressure upon the boundaries of what can or cannot be considered acceptable from an ethical perspective. Much of the literature on ethical issues related to big data and big data technologies focuses on separate values such as privacy, human dignity, justice or autonomy. More holistic approaches, allowing a more comprehensive view and better balancing of values, usually focus on either a design-based approach, in which it is tried to implement values into the design of new technologies, or an application-based approach, in which it is tried to address the ways in which new technologies are used. Some integrated approaches do exist, but typically are more general in nature. This offers a broad scope of application, but may not always be tailored to the specific nature of big data related ethical issues. In this paper we distil a comprehensive set of ethical values from existing design-based and application-based ethical approaches for new technologies and further focus these values to the context of emerging big data technologies. A total of four value lists (from techno-moral values, value-sensitive design, anticipatory emerging technology ethics and biomedical ethics) were selected for this. The integrated list consists of a total of ten values: human welfare, autonomy, non-maleficence, justice, accountability, trustworthiness, privacy, dignity, solidarity and environmental welfare. Together, this set of values provides a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the values that are to be taken into account for emerging big data technologies.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years an unprecedented wave of anti-abortion policies were introduced and enacted in state governments in the U.S., affecting millions of constituents. We study this rapid spread of policy change as a function of the underlying ideology of constituents. We examine over 200,000 public messages posted on Twitter surrounding abortion in the year 2013, a year that saw 82 new anti-abortion policies enacted. From these posts, we characterize people's expressions of opinion on abortion and show how these expressions align with policy change on these issues. We detail a number of ideological differences between constituents in states enacting anti versus pro-abortion policies, such as a tension between the moral values of purity versus fairness, and a differing emphasis on the fetus versus the pregnant woman. We also find significant differences in how males versus females discuss the issue of abortion, including greater emphasis on health and religion by males. Using these measures to characterize states, we can construct models to explain the spread of abortion policy from state to state and project which types of abortion policies a state will introduce. Models defining state similarity using our Twitter-based measures improved policy projection accuracy by 7.32% and 12.02% on average over geographic and poll-based ideological similarity, respectively. Additionally, models constructed from the expressions of male-only constituents perform better than models from the expressions of female-only constituents, suggesting that the ideology of men is more aligned with the recent spread of anti-abortion legislation than that of women.",

      "abstract": "Numerous cultural assets host a great historical and moral value, but due to their degradation, this value is heavily affected as their attractiveness is lost. One of the solutions that most heritage organizations and museums currently choose is to leverage the knowledge of art and history experts in addition to curators to recover and restore the damaged assets. This process is labor-intensive, expensive and more often results in just an assumption over the damaged or missing region. In this work, we tackle the issue of completing missing regions in artwork through advanced deep learning and image reconstruction (inpainting) techniques. Following our analysis of different image completion and reconstruction approaches, we noticed that these methods suffer from various limitations such as lengthy processing times and hard generalization when trained with multiple visual contexts. Most of the existing learning-based image completion and reconstruction techniques are trained on large datasets with the objective of retrieving the original data distribution of the training samples. However, this distribution becomes more complex when the training data is diverse making the training process difficult and the reconstruction inefficient. Through this paper, we present a clustering-based low-delay image completion and reconstruction approach which combines supervised and unsupervised learning to address the highlighted issues. We compare our technique to the current state of the art using a real-world dataset of artwork collected from various cultural institutions. Our approach is evaluated using statistical methods and a surveyed audience to better interpret our results objectively and subjectively.",

      "abstract": "Self-control predicts moral behavior. Traditional theory explains this finding by suggesting self-control works to inhibit antisocial impulses, which everyone experiences. However, Aristotle argued that by practicing virtue, people's moral thoughts, feelings, and actions align such that they no longer experience antisocial impulses. Moreover, self-control is associated with experiences of weaker temptation and reduced conflict when selecting value-consistent choices in non-moral domains. Therefore, we suggest that, rather than increased inhibition, reductions in temptation partially account for the link between self-control and value-consistent, unselfish decisions in the moral domain. Study 1 supported the reduction hypothesis and demonstrated greater harmony among the morally-relevant thoughts, feelings, and decisions of people higher (vs. lower) in trait self-control. Study 2 (preregistered) conceptually replicated Study 1 by employing an online, behavioral measure of temptation across more numerous moral decisions: mouse tracking. Study 3 (preregistered) extended Study 2 by also examining the strategies those high in self-control employ to automatically pursue goals, here in the moral domain—namely, moral habits and the construal of immoral acts as impossible. Study 3 replicated the finding that people high (versus low) in self-control more often make unselfish choices on proscriptive (ought not) moral decisions and extended this finding to prescriptive (ought to) moral choices, but did not replicate the finding that people higher, versus low, in self-control display less moral temptation. Together, findings suggest that self-control facilitates the integration of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors with moral values, and may aid the automatization of their application, consistent with Aristotle's conception of virtue.",

      "abstract": "In today’s world, competition among countries is not just a contest of hard force, but also a contest of soft power. China has a five-thousand-year-old history and civilization, with a strong traditional moral culture at its core. The university stage is an important time for college students to develop their worldview, outlook on life, and values. In this context, excellent traditional and moral culture education plays an important role and significance in their development. College students are the country’s future builders and an important force to inherit China’s excellent moral culture. The rapid development of the modern Internet era has made the channels for college students to understand and accept the cultures of various countries more and more diverse and convenient. Actively borrowing their essence can help promote the development of Chinese culture, but we must also pay attention to active defense and resistance against the dregs of culture. This paper discusses the current situation and problems of the acceptance status of excellent traditional moral culture among college students and analyses the factors that restrict the acceptance of excellent traditional moral culture among college students to conduct a large-scale study on the acceptance status of traditional moral culture in colleges and universities. A model based on convolutional neural networks is suggested for predicting college students’ embrace of traditional moral values. By learning and describing their activities and preferences on the Internet, the model assesses and creates college students’ acceptance status for conventional moral culture. Extensive tests indicate that the suggested technique can successfully assess college students’ acceptance status for traditional moral culture, and the model’s superior performance is supported by test results.",

      "abstract": "The pedagogical thought of the twenty-first century addresses the pressing issues of education. The article presents an analysis of the development of the ideas in the didactic theory of general education. The purpose of the study is to analyze the current state of the education system in Russia and to present the impact of a certain historical period on the social, cultural, and scientific attitudes of school education. The scientific novelty of the study is our classification of the content of education: classical - non-classical-post-non-classical. New approaches to the organization of the pedagogical process and the education of the cultural type of personality in it are identified. This indicates the need for the development of modern human competencies in the field of communication, the development and processing of information, and social actions. As a result of our research, we were able to identify the following. A new target for school education is being formed. It is important to form knowledge that adequate to the current level of the scientific picture of the world; to develop constructive cognitive abilities; to contribute to the development of moral values and personal meanings. The trend in understanding the content of school education and its pedagogical process is determined: from the \"transfer of the basics of science\" in the aspect of classical concepts to the personal development of the student. Thus, all these changes are now considered as social and cultural challenges to modern education, didactics as a theory and school teaching as a practice, which are designed to provide an answer based on both the traditions of Russian education and innovations.",

      "abstract": "Culture has been recognized as a driving impetus for human development. It co-evolves with both human belief and behavior. When studying culture, Cultural Mapping is a crucial tool to visualize different aspects of culture (e.g., religions and languages) from the perspectives of indigenous and local people. Existing cultural mapping approaches usually rely on large-scale survey data with respect to human beliefs, such as moral values. However, such a data collection method not only incurs a significant cost of both human resources and time, but also fails to capture human behavior, which massively reflects cultural information. In addition, it is practically difficult to collect large-scale human behavior data. Fortunately, with the recent boom in Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), a considerable number of users report their activities in LBSNs in a participatory manner, which provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to study large-scale user behavioral data. In this article, we propose a participatory cultural mapping approach based on collective behavior in LBSNs. First, we collect the participatory sensed user behavioral data from LBSNs. Second, since only local users are eligible for cultural mapping, we propose a progressive “home” location identification method to filter out ineligible users. Third, by extracting three key cultural features from daily activity, mobility, and linguistic perspectives, respectively, we propose a cultural clustering method to discover cultural clusters. Finally, we visualize the cultural clusters on the world map. Based on a real-world LBSN dataset, we experimentally validate our approach by conducting both qualitative and quantitative analysis on the generated cultural maps. The results show that our approach can subtly capture cultural features and generate representative cultural maps that correspond well with traditional cultural maps based on survey data.",

      "abstract": "This article provides the background and concept of Thailand Lifelong Learning [LLL], even attempting a definition. The Thai LLL vision encompasses strategies for developing human qualities such as integrity, self-reliance, adaptability, resilience, and spirituality, to name a few. In some regards LLL seeks to recapture a more fully-developed perspective, on what in earlier times and places [1238 AD in Thailand], was called 'indigenous education', as it now pursues the benefits of a vibrant Learning Society. Progress of LLL in Thailand at times seems to be very slow and methodological rather than dynamic. It stems from developing a policy of learning processes for establishing solid education systems-Formal, Non-Formal, and Informal. LLL also has developed by means of garnering and integrating 'Local Wisdom' [a Thai term designating important valued human experience] into what has become known as 'cultural learning processes'. This Local Wisdom is held by 'Wisdom Teachers' and encompasses nine areas, as follows: agriculture, handicraft/cottage industry, traditional medicine, conservation of natural resources, funding/community economics, fine arts, languages/literatures, philosophy/religion/tradition, and food/nutrition. Government Organizations and Private Non-Governmental Organizations have strongly supported and have been major forces for advancing cultural learning, LLL, and what may be labeled as a 'Learning Society'. In addition, collaboration between Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok [Thailand's premier university] and Lindenwood University, St. Charles, Missouri, USA, has helped Thai LLL advance immeasurably and move toward becoming a Learning Society from 2010 to 2015. Added to this, and provided a Model of Cultural Learning, with recommendations for improvement at the National and Community levels. It concludes with assurances toward its creating diversity within the constituencies to be served, strengthening a self-sufficient economy, solidifying moral values, and enhancing Thailand's becoming a vibrant and flourishing Lifelong Learning Society.",

      "abstract": "This thesis addresses three themes relating to climate change. The first is which types of fossil fuel to leave in the ground when they can differ in both their extraction cost and emissions rate. The analysis shows that without resource constraints there will always be use of at least one fossil fuel in the steady-state. With exhaustion constraints, any fossil fuel that has a lower extraction cost than the marginal cost of the backstop will be extracted in finite time regardless of the emissions rate. The only environmental consideration is the timing of extraction rather than leaving fossil fuel stock in the ground forever. The second theme is how altruistic concern of individuals for the well-being of others influences the socially optimal consumption levels and optimal emissions tax in a global context. If individuals have altruistic concern but believe that their consumption is negligible, they will not change their behaviour. However, non-cooperative governments maximising domestic welfare will internalise some of the damage inflicted on other countries depending on the level of altruistic concern individuals have and the cooperative optimum also changes as altruism leads individuals to effectively experience damage in other countries as well as the direct damage to them. Still, for behaviour to change, individuals need to make their decisions in a different way. The third chapter develops a new theory of moral behaviour whereby individuals balance the cost of not acting in their own self-interest against the hypothetical moral value of adopting a Kantian form of behaviour, asking what would happen if everyone else acted in the same way as they did. If individuals behave this way, then altruism matters and it may induce individuals to cut back their consumption. But nevertheless the optimal environmental tax is exactly the same as the standard Pigovian tax.",

      "abstract": "Big data is becoming increasingly multimedia data. Storytelling is one of the oldest and the most popular activity for humans. Historically, since the early days of human existence, storytelling has been used as a means of simple communication as well as medium of entertainment, education of people, cultural preservation, and instilling moral values through examples. A story is presentation of experiences related to events. Events and their experiences are selected to communicate the intent of a story compellingly. The art of storytelling always had close relationship to technology of the time. A good story considers the message and the audience and then selects appropriate events and proper related experiential media and information to weave a compelling and engaging account of the events.There is a virtuous cycle between storytelling and the technology that is intertwined and synergistic. Historically, both have evolved together and are likely to continue evolving together in the near future. Most events of interest occur in physical world and must be captured using different sensors. Usually a single sensor is inadequate to capture diverse aspects of the event and hence the use of multiple sensors or media to capture an event and also to present event experiences for re-experiencing the events. Now we have diverse sensors to capture an event in all its details and use what will be compelling in storytelling.A good story is the result of many activities: collection of data, analysis of data, selection of events and experiences that are relevant to the message, and a compelling presentation using this material. All of these activities are active research areas in multimedia big data. We discuss different forms of storytelling as they evolved and the role of technology in different stages of storytelling. We believe that now we have powerful tools and technologies to make the art of storytelling really effective. In this presentation we will show challenges for multimedia researchers that could make storytelling very effective and very compelling.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing need for norms to be embedded in technology as the widespread deployment of applications such as autonomous driving, warfare and big data analysis for crime fighting and counter-terrorism becomes ever closer. Current approaches to norms in multi-agent systems tend either to simply make prohibited actions unavailable, or to provide a set of rules (principles) which the agent is obliged to follow, either as part of its design or to avoid sanctions and punishments. In this paper we argue for the position that agents should be equipped with the ability to reason about a system's norms, by reasoning about the social and moral values that norms are designed to serve; that is, perform the sort of moral reasoning we expect of humans. In particular we highlight the need for such reasoning when circumstances are such that the rules should arguably be broken, so that the reasoning can guide agents in deciding whether to comply with the norms and, if violation is desirable, how best to violate them. One approach to enabling this is to make use of an argumentation scheme based on values and designed for practical reasoning: arguments for and against actions are generated using this scheme and agents choose between actions based on their preferences over these values. Moral reasoning then requires that agents have an acceptable set of values and an acceptable ordering on their values. We first discuss how this approach can be used to think about and justify norms in general, and then discuss how this reasoning can be used to think about when norms should be violated, and the form this violation should take. We illustrate how value based reasoning can be used to decide when and how to violate a norm using a road traffic example. We also briefly consider what makes an ordering on values acceptable, and how such an ordering might be determined.",

      "abstract": "We are living in a society in which we are all connected in one way or another; bound together in social cooperation. This thesis is primarily concerned with the terms of our cooperation and with how accounting can contribute to the justice, as fairness, of those terms. Accounting practice, and the principles that shape it, make a significant contribution to the regulation of our social relations, in the business sphere and beyond, by dictating what information should be collected and what is to be disclosed in corporate reports and how; who is to give and who is entitled to receive accounts and of what. Such reports contribute to the governance of society by providing information on which action can be taken, and by having inductive effects on the behaviour of managers and others. I maintain therefore, that accounting, has the potential to help support the development of a more just society and, a fairer system of social cooperation. This is a potential that I hope this thesis can play a part, albeit an entirely theoretical part, in helping to bring to realisation. I turn to the work of the political philosopher John Rawls to guide my consideration of justice in accounting. I use what I see as three stages in the development of Rawls thought as a framework for my analysis. The thesis is therefore divided into three main parts: Firstly, his seminal formulation A Theory of Justice Rawls develops to approach justice and justification; Secondly, the development of his thinking designed to accommodate his recognition of the implications of reasonable pluralism leading to the development of Political Liberalism, and a political conception of justice; Thirdly, the late development of Rawls thinking in response to critique, and in particular his engagement with the critical perspective of J\\\"{u}rgen Habermas, and his turn to a more discursive interpretations of his position. I find, and show, that Rawls provides us with tools that we can use to improve our thinking about justice in accounting. The potential of these tools including the method of reflective equilibrium and the device of the original position has been relatively neglected; I show that given a discursive reading these ideas can and should have an important place in critical accounting thinking. I find that strong, but thin, moral foundations are vital to our justification of concepts of justice and to critique, and I show that we can have such foundations without lapsing into traditional metaphysics. I find that following Rawls in this exploration of justice opens a new perspective on accountability, as justification and a practice of equality. He offers us ways to think about justice in accounting that are better than the utilitarian and intuitionist traditions that have held accounting practice thinking about a fair accounting in their conceptual grip; better justified and better able to account for our considered judgements.",

      "abstract": "Modern capitalism is a success for some, but not for all. The examples of the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, Nike's sweatshops and the demise of Enron and Arthur Anderson show how irresponsible leaders prioritise corporate needs and profit ahead of society's wider interests. As a result, there is an increasing interest in higher purpose forms of leadership such as Responsible Leadership (RL) with its concern for the wider stakeholder community and ethically informed governance and management decision making. This thesis presents new empirical findings from an inductive thematic analysis of Responsible Leadership as practiced within seven organisations. The findings and subsequent conclusions were developed from a cross case analysis of twenty one interviews with the responsible leaders and their organisations' stakeholders. A process theory of responsible leadership was developed from the findings. This process details the journey of the RL participants from their early life to establishing and then growing their organisation whose primary aim was social betterment. The participant RLs studied came to responsible leadership as a result of experiences in their formative years where they had become sensitive to the plight of others less fortunate than themselves. This ultimately led to their activation in creating an organisation with the explicit aim of improving the lives of these individuals/communities. The interpretations of the constituent themes of what it is to be a responsible leader indicate that the personal moral values (e.g. universalism and benevolence) of each of the RLs studied were the cornerstone of why they had become a RL and that these values prioritised social concerns above profit. These personal values also underpinned the aims and mission of their organisation and their leadership approach. It is this personal value set that the RLs recruited employees against and where they were not present actively excluded applicants, presenting as a dichotomy with the RL espoused values of inclusivity. Other findings that emerged from the study include an emergent theory of responsible leadership that differentiates it from responsible management and further insights into the boundary of RL stakeholder inclusion. This study also expands our understanding of responsible leadership, provides insights for practice and suggests productive avenues for further investigation.",

      "abstract": "\"Videogames are the dominant art form of the 21st century. How we go about designing and creating them, what we choose to say and express with them, and how we engage with and play them, reflects and informs our behavior and broader understanding of morality and ethics. In this book, Zagal has collected a series of essays that offer an amazing array of perspectives and views. Game designers, sociologists, legal scholars, media theorists, game researchers, philosophers, and more, all offer their views and insights on varied and diverse sets of issues. Topics include potential effects of violent content in videogames, cheating and anti-social behavior, business practices in the games industry, social and cultural diversity and representation in games, moral values in games and gameplay, freedom of expression, and how games are uniquely positioned as an art form to encourage players to reflect on ethics and morality. The Videogame Ethics Reader is a unique collection of writings on videogames and ethics by leading scholars and practitioners. It includes game analyses, case studies, and thought-provoking essays that serve as a valuable companion to traditional ethics textbooks. This book provides an entry point for thinking, deliberating, and discussing ethical topics surrounding videogames and their accompanying technologies. It also serves as a springboard for examining how this relatively new medium can provide us with insights on many of the moral and ethical questions that have been with us for centuries. \" \" Dr. Jos P. Zagal is a game designer and scholar. He serves on the faculty at DePaul Universitys College of Computing and Digital Media where he teaches a variety of courses on game design and analysis, online communities, and ethics. In his research he explores the analysis, design, and use of videogames for encouraging ethical reasoning and reflection. He is also interested in supporting games literacy through the use of collaborative learning environments. His book on this topic, Ludoliteracy: Defining, Understanding, and Supporting Games Education was published in 2010. Zagal is a member of the executive board of the Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA). He has published many articles on videogames in leading journals in the field of game studies and regularly presents on these and other topics at international conferences.\"",

      "abstract": "The web has evolved from a piece of software code into an interdependent techno-social system of multi-purpose functionalities. From an interlinked bulletin board with low levels of interaction, a system of multiple interlocking contexts has developed which is now responsible for a substantial share of our financial transactions. Users not only post and link digital content, but also communicate, work, advertise, and exchange information. Multi-fold social and economic interactions result in a dynamic compound of moral values and code. Web Science constitutes a systematic effort to investigate the salient features and implications of this compound by studying the web as a self-standing techno-social artifact. The economic aspects of the web are fundamental but still unexplored in this agenda. The scope of this survey article is twofold: (a) to analyze how the web economy differs from traditional settings and what the implications of these differences are and (b) to formalize a minimal common understanding on the subject of incentives and mechanisms in the web economy. Accordingly, the concept of web goods, a classification of web users and the main functions of the web economy are introduced. This effort is not, by any means, a thorough review of the economic literature related to the web. The focus is on the web as a standalone economic artifact with its own functionality and processes. Our approach is to study goods, users, models, and policies within the web perspective, hopefully contributing to the initiation of Web Economics as a field which investigates the economic motives and implications of the web. In particular, we look at how we can achieve the right balance between open access to online information while also providing proper incentives, producing content, and developing network infrastructure. Moreover, we examine how we can accelerate development by facilitating life-critical functions, transparency, and participation.WSSC Classification:\"webscience.org/2010/E.1.1.1 Goods in the web\"\"webscience.org/2010/E.1.1.2 The web economy\"\"webscience.org/2010/E.1.1.4 Antitrust Issues and Policies on the web\"\"webscience.org/2010/E.1.1.6 Web-based economic development\"\"webscience.org/2010/E.1.2.3 Advertising on the web, sponsored search\"",

      "abstract": "I give an account of conscience as a mental process that compares an agent's considered actions to her internalized moral norms.  The dictates of conscience sometimes conflict with both an agent's reflectively endorsed moral beliefs and the requirements of objective morality.  Despite these errors, conscience is useful as a moral heuristic that can quickly and effortless provide action-guidance in situations in which an agent is unable to deliberate or reflect.  Further, it can alert us to the fact that something morally valuable is at stake, thus prompting further reflection when the circumstances allow.  I argue that the fact that an agent acted on her conscience can affect others' moral evaluation of her actions, but that sometimes morality requires the violation of conscience.  In deciding how to act, an agent always ought to consider and properly weigh the dictates of her conscience.Discussions of freedom of conscience should be understood as referring to the subset of an agent's conscience that concerns her reflectively endorsed moral values.  I describe three closely related domains of freedom of conscience: the freedom to hold one's own moral views, the freedom to express one's conscience, and the freedom to act in accord with one's conscience.  I argue that there are moral limits to freedom within all three domains.  Other agents acting as private citizens and outside of the bounds of special relationship-based obligations are sometimes permitted to interfere with another agent's expression of conscience or conscience-based actions when doing so is necessary to prevent harm to others.  Conscience-based freedoms are highly affected by context.  Within the context of medical care, I argue that a physician is required not just to abide by the principles of medical ethics in action, but further to commit to and internalize these requirements such that they become a part of her conscience.  A physician is sometimes morally permitted to refuse to provide patients with requested medical care when doing so would violate her conscience.  However, health care institutions are permitted determine the scope of medical care that physicians may provide as a condition of their employment.",

      "abstract": "This thesis explores the concept of dirty hands in democracies. It argues that dirty hands are instances of moral conflicts in which some of our core moral values and commitments clash. Accepting the existence of such a clash, contrary to what some critics have argued, does not have to be irrational and we can make sense of this phenomenon irrespective of the wider beliefs about the nature of rational moral judgement that we hold. The thesis goes on to defend the view that getting one's hands dirty results in a moral remainder that can best be described as \"tragic-remorse\". Experiencing this emotional response, it is argued, fulfils important functions because it helps the agent understand what is morally required in the situation, ensures that they deliberate in the right way, and makes their behaviour intelligible to others. The thesis then goes on to argue that being confronted with a dirty hands conflict is particularly pernicious because, once faced with such a situation, it is impossible to keep our hands clean. Dirty hands therefore point us towards morality's tragic nature. The thesis then questions what this means for democratic politics. It rejects criticisms that dirty hands can, neither in theory nor in practice, be compatible with democratic politics. If dirty-handed measures can indeed be a part of democratic politics, we should then ask who gets their hands dirty and can share the moral responsibility for the dirty-handed outcome. The thesis emphasises that political leaders do not share this burden alone. They act in a complicated web of relations with other politicians and public officials and many of them will get their hands dirty as well. Additionally, it is argued, to the extent that citizens voluntarily participate in or contribute to a given dirty-handed decision or the wider democratic process, they will also share some of the dirt and moral responsibility for what their politicians do for them and in their name. The thesis concludes by arguing that dirty hands in democratic politics are not borne by a single political leader acting alone, but are shared by many in the polity.",

      "abstract": "In this dissertation the question addressed is the ethical protocol that should be used when enhanced, post or transhumans present themselves as patients to hospitals, or as subjects for scientific research. With the advent of the birth of four children who were genetically engineered in China to be resistant to HIV, I contend that transhumans are already here, and the prevailing Western paradigm of principlism, while good, is not adequate to the task. I explore the basic religious argument that can be used against or in favor of what I call human-directed human evolution. I show how the fears of new kinds of persons are can be traced not just to myth, but also to the genre of science fiction. I start with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus, through Star-Trek's Borg Queen, and forward to BBC America's \"Orphan Black\". The argument for moral enhancement, a concept for which Julian Savulescu argues, is examined as is Nick Bostrom's explication of superintelligence, and his joining Savulescu's call for an enhancement of moral values. Several technologies currently in use for genetic testing, and that can be used for genetic engineering will be explained. These include preimplantation genetic diagnosis and mitochondrial replacement techniques (MRT), which are used to avoid birth defects in potential offspring. CRISPR-Cas9, TALENs, cloning and haploid stem cells are the technologies that not only can be used to develop specific treatment mechanisms, but they are the mechanisms that will allow humankind to engineer new kinds of persons, thus creating transhumans. From here I address the two prevailing sides of how to proceed: precaution where we move slowly trying to ascertain and prepare for any negative eventuality, and proaction where we move directly ahead after we have done all we can to prepare but opt to adjust along the way as the need arises. The ethical argument I make for the protocol that I think must be adopted does not just come from an examination of principlism. I also incorporate concepts from Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam, Hinduism and African philosophy. I posit that two other principles are needed: Particularity and Intrinsic Personhood.",

      "abstract": "The word 'ethics' is under siege in technology policy circles. Weaponized in support of deregulation, self-regulation or handsoff governance, \"ethics\" is increasingly identified with technology companies' self-regulatory efforts and with shallow appearances of ethical behavior. So-called \"ethics washing\" by tech companies is on the rise, prompting criticism and scrutiny from scholars and the tech community at large. In parallel to the growth of ethics washing, its condemnation has led to a tendency to engage in \"ethics bashing.\" This consists in the trivialization of ethics and moral philosophy now understood as discrete tools or pre-formed social structures such as ethics boards, self-governance schemes or stakeholder groups.The misunderstandings underlying ethics bashing are at least threefold: (a) philosophy and \"ethics\" are seen as a communications strategy and as a form of instrumentalized cover-up or fa\\c{c}ade for unethical behavior, (b) philosophy is understood in opposition and as alternative to political representation and social organizing and (c) the role and importance of moral philosophy is downplayed and portrayed as mere \"ivory tower\" intellectualization of complex problems that need to be dealt with in practice.This paper argues that the rhetoric of ethics and morality should not be reductively instrumentalized, either by the industry in the form of \"ethics washing,\" or by scholars and policy-makers in the form of \"ethics bashing.\" Grappling with the role of philosophy and ethics requires moving beyond both tendencies and seeing ethics as a mode of inquiry that facilitates the evaluation of competing tech policy strategies. In other words, we must resist narrow reductivism of moral philosophy as instrumentalized performance and renew our faith in its intrinsic moral value as a mode of knowledgeseeking and inquiry. Far from mandating a self-regulatory scheme or a given governance structure, moral philosophy in fact facilitates the questioning and reconsideration of any given practice, situating it within a complex web of legal, political and economic institutions. Moral philosophy indeed can shed new light on human practices by adding needed perspective, explaining the relationship between technology and other worthy goals, situating technology within the human, the social, the political. It has become urgent to start considering technology ethics also from within and not only from outside of ethics.",

      "abstract": "This thesis collects three papers studying topics in development and cultural economics. In Chapter 1, I study the role of culture in driving entrepreneurship. I present robust evidence that cultural groups which emphasize obedience as a moral value produce fewer entrepreneurs. First, I document this relationship at the language group level, exploiting within-country variation in group-level values. Second, I show that these group-level values continue to predict entrepreneurship rates and related occupational choices among first- and second-generation immigrants to Canada. Third, I present evidence that obedience values form as a function of values received both from parents and from the wider community during childhood.In Chapter 2, I present joint work with Limin Fang and Tongtong Hao on the effects of China's One Child Policy on the education and early labour market outcomes of those born in its wake. We present evidence from a difference-in-difference design that individuals who grew up as only children as a result of the policy obtained significantly more education than their counterparts with siblings, while early labour market outcomes were less affected. We place our results in context of the large literature on quantity-quality tradeoffs and argue that they are consistent with existing theoretical models, which allow for non-linearity in the effect of child quantity on quality.In Chapter 3, I study the effect of natural resource abundance on human development in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1970 and 2013. I use cross-section and panel IV analysis to identify the long- and short-run impacts of resource wealth on human development, measured primarily by infant mortality. I find that natural resource revenue has had zero average impact on infant mortality rates in the short run and a potentially negative impact in the long run, despite increasing budget resources and reported health spending. I further find that while democratic transitions are generally followed by a drop in infant mortality, this is not true in resource rich nations with weak constraints on power. I conclude that the pass-through of natural resource wealth to broad-based development in Africa has been weak and that electoral competition without deeper political reform is unlikely to turn things around.",

      "abstract": "What is the most general common set of\nattributes that characterises something as\nintrinsically valuable\nand hence as subject to some moral respect, and\nwithout which something would rightly be\nconsidered intrinsically worthless or even positively\nunworthy and therefore rightly to be\ndisrespected in itself? This\npaper develops and supports the thesis that the\nminimal condition of possibility of an entity's\nleast intrinsic value is to be identified with its\nontological status as an information object.\nAll entities, even when interpreted as only clusters of\ninformation, still have a minimal moral worth\nqua information objects and so may deserve to be respected. The\npaper is organised into four main sections.\nSection 1 models moral action as an information system\nusing the object-oriented programming\nmethodology (OOP). Section 2 addresses the question of what\nrole the several components constituting the\nmoral system can have in an ethical analysis. If they\ncan play only an instrumental role, then\nComputer Ethics (CE) is probably bound to remain at most a\npractical, field-dependent, applied or\nprofessional ethics. However, Computer Ethics can give rise to a\nmacroethical approach, namely Information\nEthics (IE), if one can show that ethical concern should be\nextended to include not only human, animal or\nbiological entities, but also information objects. The\nfollowing two sections show how this minimalist\nlevel of analysis can be achieved. Section 3 provides an\naxiological analysis of information objects. It\ncriticises the Kantian approach to the concept of\nintrinsic value and shows that it can be\nimproved by using the methodology introduced in the first section.\nThe solution of the Kantian problem prompts the\nreformulation of the key question concerning\nthe moral worth of an entity: what is the\nintrinsic value of x qua an object constituted by its\ninherited attributes? In answering this\nquestion, it is argued that entities\ncan share different observable properties\ndepending on the level of abstraction adopted,\nand that it is still possible to speak of moral value even at the\nhighest level of ontological abstraction\nrepresented by the informational analysis. Section 4 develops a\nminimalist axiology based on the concept of\ninformation object. It further supports IE's position by\naddressing five objections that may undermine\nits acceptability.",

      "abstract": "Theories related to cognitive sciences, Human-in-the-loop Cyber-physical systems, data analysis for decision-making, and computational ethics make clear the need to create transdisciplinary learning, research, and application strategies to bring coherence to the paradigm of a truly human-oriented technology. Autonomous objects assume more responsibilities for individual and collective phenomena, they have gradually filtered into routines and require the incorporation of ethical practice into the professions related to the development, modeling, and design of algorithms. To make this possible, it is pertinent and urgent to bring them closer to the problems and approaches of the humanities. Increasingly transdisciplinary research must be part of the construction of systems that provide developers and scientists with the necessary bases to understand the ethical debate and therefore their commitment to society. This article considers two theories as articulating axes: Blumenberg’s, coming from the field of philosophy, for whom the process of technification and especially the implementation of mathematical models in their algorithmic form leads to an emptying of meaning and therefore makes programmers who implement their functions to be alien to the concerns that gave them origin; Daston’s, belonging to the field of the history of science and according to which the division of labor in the processes of technification of the calculation implies a kind of subordination in which those who implement the inventions of a small group of privileged mathematicians ignore the procedures that put them into operation. Given these two theories, the black box models prevalent in AI development, and the urgency of establishing explanatory frameworks for the development of computational ethics, this article exposes the need to give a voice to the cultural history of consciousness for promoting the discussions around the implementation of mathematical algorithms. The paper takes as a reference the different points of view that have emerged around the study of technological ethics, its applicability, management, and design. It criticizes the current state of studies from a humanistic perspective and explains how the historical perspective allows promoting the training of software engineers, developers and creators so that they assume intuitions and moral values in the development of their work. Specifically, it aims to expose how cultural history, applied to the study of consciousness and its phenomena, makes those involved in this technological revolution aware of the effect that they, through their algorithms, have on society in general and on human beings in particular.",

      "abstract": "This thesis is a social genealogy of gambling. It examines both aleatory artifacts used to gamble, and the gambling ritual itself, its functions, and its expression of a cosmological viewpoint. I theorize that gambling is a specialized form of the interaction ritual machine’ originally described by sociologist Emile Durkheim, comprised of an assembled group, a series of scripted actions, and a shared mood or emotion. The gambling ritual is called upon as a sacred or holy ritual, meant to access larger cosmological forces in order to determine outcomes in a moral order. In its original forms, gambling was directly practiced as sortilege, or mechanical divination, and called upon variously as a form of medicine or a means of ethical resolution in the face of conflicting or ambiguous moral values, such as the lots drawn by sailors to determine the guilt of Jonah. As aleatory artifacts themselves become refined over time, as well as the cosmological narratives they reify, they comprise a vital technology base for the transmission of cultural ideas, serving to regulate mental categories Durkheim describes as time, space, number, personality, and causality. Additionally, the collective efforts to systematically understand gambling as a mathematical problem were at the heart of the development of probability theory. The renaissance scholar Gerolamo Cardano in particular expressed the first modern version of chance and probability theory in an effort to understand dice throws, and communicated his ideas to other prominent scholars including Galileo, who was among the first to question why street gamblers were so well versed in applied probability. The distribution of dice throws was eventually applied by Simpson to a theory of errors in astronomical observation, ultimately laying the groundwork resulting in Laplace’s expression of the central limit theorem and Gauss’s development of the bell curve. In our contemporary moment, the study of zero-sum games of chance led John Von Neumann and Oscar Morganstern to develop the minimax theorem, a mathematical expression of the maximized self-interest of the economic rational actor. These techniques, along with the theory of normal distribution, afforded the possibility of computational ‘Monte Carlo’ simulation, instrumental in allowing Von Neumann and his team to use computers as an aleatory artifact to ‘shuffle’ neutrons and model their collision in the core an exploding atomic bomb. I refer to this outcome of the study of gambling resulting in advanced weapons technology as a ‘golem’, a term originally developed by Collins and Pinch. As advanced poker playing artificial intelligence is being deployed based on Von Neumann and John Nash’s original work in optimal mixed strategy, I conducted participant observation ethnography of online poker players in an attempt to situate their expertise once again in interaction ritual chains, rather than as a form of advanced computational algorithm. I claim that expertise is cultivated by participating in the gambling ritual, allowing mental categories of time, space, number, personality, and causality to be encoded in human posture for expert play.",

      "abstract": "When examining the position and norms of translated children's literature, researchers tend to speak of the 'Arab world' rather than a specific country. Although the Arab world shares a language, it does not have a single culture, economy, politics, etc. Variations between different countries are reflected in its translated children's literature. Picturebooks are made up of a verbal mode, visual mode and the combination of these two modes (i.e. intermodal relations). Nonetheless, researchers tend only to consider the verbal mode in regard to picturebooks, ignoring the visual mode and the intermodal relations. In light of these gaps, this research aims to assess the position and norms of translated children's literature within the Saudi market as well as examine picturebooks in their entirety. To do so, this thesis asks five main questions: 1) What is the position of translated children's literature in Saudi Arabia? 2) How are textual, paratextual and metatextual aspects of Arabic target texts correlated to the position of translated children's literature in Saudi Arabia? 3) What translational initial norms are adopted to translate elements in the verbal and visual modes? 4) Which intermodal relations can be identified in the source and target texts, and how are they approached in translation? 5) What norms govern children's literature translated from English into Arabic in Saudi Arabia? Based on Even-Zohar's polysystem theory (1990), Toury's notion of norms (2012a) and Kress and van Leeuwen's (2001) multimodal approach, a comparative multimodal analysis of elements, translation techniques and intermodal relations was carried out on twenty cases. All distributed in the Saudi market, these cases were published by four publishers originating from three different Arab countries: Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Lebanon. The analytical framework combines the Composite Translation Techniques Model, the Composite Elements Model and Nikolajeva and Scott's (2000) typology of image-text relationships. To assess the position of translated children's literature, this study looks at the volume of translated children's literature from and into Saudi Arabia, as well as the volume of translated Saudi children's literature in comparison to original Saudi children's literature and Saudis' perception of the state of the latter. To explore the hypothetical links to the position of translation, textual (i.e. initial norms), metatextual elements (i.e. perception) and paratextual elements (i.e. price, binding type, publishing format and the (in)visibility of translators' and authors' names) are examined. There are three types of norms in this research: elements, translation techniques and element-specific translation technique(s), which are extracted using a comparative multimodal analysis to identify regularities of behaviour and are argued based on Chesterman's (2017) normative forces. The dynamicity of norms in translated children's literature in Saudi Arabia is explained in terms of Chang's (2000) macro-polysystem hypothesis. The results indicate that translated children's literature in Saudi Arabia seems to occupy a central position in the children's literature polysystem. However, contrary to Even-Zohar's hypothesis, this position is mostly accompanied by a TL-oriented translation method. Similarly, metatextual and paratextual aspects examined in this research show no clear connection to the proposed position. Despite being multimodal, picturebooks are treated mainly as monomodal verbal texts in which each mode has a different translation method. The use of TL-oriented translation techniques, such as substitution, visual substitution, modulation and discursive creation has caused many intermodal relation shifts in TTs. A hypothetical link between a higher number of intermodal relation shifts and a higher degree of TL-orientation has been established, which is confirmed by an initial test. Results also identify several norms in translated children's literature available in the Saudi market. Examples include the non-occurrence of alcohol, the clear presence of social and moral values, the adoption of visual repetition and the literal translation of elements involving mythical and magical creatures.",

      "abstract": "I propose a political philosophical account of justified secession in order to tackle the thorny conceptual issue of what a right of secession amounts to, given that the state normally forbids or restricts secession by appeal to its legitimate jurisdiction, whereas secessionists and minorities advocate a primary interest in self-determination and ask for more permissive conditions on secession. The following core claim threads through my dissertation: even though (1) the current boundaries of (state) territory are a result of historical contingency, and (2) qualified claimants to secession are entitled to the same moral standing as the host states in securing their territorial interests, (3) both agents (i.e. secessionists and states) should limit their rights to propose or prohibit secession, because their rights to territories are justified provisionally and conditionally. The first proposition reveals a certain understanding of the modern state system, according to which we should recognise its contingent, arbitrary composition (i.e. where the boundaries are drawn and what particular group is subject to what state) and unjust genesis as a significant difficulty that the extant states as rulers ought to at least attempt to overcome. That is to say, states are obliged to mitigate the impact of their own unjust genesis and to convince their subjects to accept the arbitrary composition (i.e. the fact that they happen to be subject to a particular state) in order to justify their rights to particular territories (i.e. territorial rights). By 'convince', I mean that the state should ameliorate the arbitrariness with moral values in order to help its subjects tolerate that problematic feature. As suggested by Margaret Moore and Anna Stilz, on whose work I draw, these values are basic justice, rights of occupancy and collective self-determination. The same historical contingency also shapes people's rights to collective self-determination. First, if the composition of state is a matter of historical contingency, then who becomes the advantaged group(s) dominating a particular state or what group may claim secession is likewise affected by that same contingency. Second, while a dominant group in a state often prioritises their corporate (territorial) interests with respect to those of other subgroups, the right to territorial integrity or the state's moral standing in terms of non-interference in domestic affairs usually exacerbates partiality or bias in favour of the dominant group. In such a scenario, the collective self-determination of the state reduces, wrongfully, to the self-determination of the ruling group. However, thirdly, this implies another account of territorial rights or state territory: that is, the state derives its territorial rights by securing the collective self-determination of all self-determining peoples within its territory. By self-determining people, according to Moore, we refer to a certain kind of territorially concentrated sub-state group, able to form a government, and holding a shared political (group) identity and history of cooperation. Provided that the state's rights to territory is constituted by the territorial rights of its self-determining peoples, the state should be conceived as an entity in which several proto-states/self-determining peoples are potentially embedded. As a result, we should deem such a subgroup to be a qualified claimant to secession and so the group is entitled to the moral standing (same as the host state) in protecting their territorial interests. Connecting to the foregoing, statist account, I shall propose my dualistic account of territorial rights, accommodating and recognising the territorial interests of self-determining people. The achievement of a state in securing basic justice, rights of occupancy and collective self-determination, or the identification of qualified claimant to secession, does not constitute the whole picture of the right to secede. I shall further argue that my dualistic account of territorial rights is justified if and only if the rights-holders (namely the state and self-determining people) are also committed to the establishment of a global political authority. This reflects the Kantian idea of permissive laws that, firstly, states' territorial rights over particular populations and territories should be taken as unilateral acquisitions and settlement from the viewpoint of outsiders, so that there is a case for a just global authority to be erected to address such unilateralism. However, secondly, before such an authority is erected, we should still grant unilateral jurisdiction over territory, provided that such recognition is necessary to bring about that global authority or rightful conditions around the world. Besides, the new account of territorial rights can entail principles for justified secession, which articulate the circumstances in which a claim to consensual or unilateral secession is morally justified. It will be shown that the normative basis of justified secession, in addition to grave injustice, refers also to persistent alienation, while different degrees of that wrong make legitimate consensual or unilateral secession. Based upon these analyses, I propose that the right of secession, as a group right, should be redefined as the right of a subgroup to have an equal moral/legal standing when re-negotiating terms and conditions (for the protection of territorial rights) with the host state or any relevant agent. It thus consists in the remedial right to claim secession, the primary right to constitutional reform, and the primary right to erect a just global authority jointly with the extant, recognised states. A subgroup, however, can only propose unilateral secession as the remedy for grave injustice or serious violation of collective autonomy; it should also be endowed with the preceding primary rights for better protecting the territorial rights or group autonomy of its members.",

Values are commonly accepted answers to why some option is desirable in the ethical sense and are thus essential both in real-world argumentation and theoretical argumentation frameworks. However, their large variety has been a major obstacle to modeling them in argument mining. To overcome this obstacle, we contribute an operationalization of human values, namely a multi-level taxonomy with 54 values that is in line with psychological research. Moreover, we provide a dataset of 5270 arguments from four geographical cultures, manually annotated for human values. First experiments with the automatic classification of human values are promising, with F$_1$-scores up to 0.81 and 0.25 on average.",
